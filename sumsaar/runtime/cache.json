    "content": "New Delhi:\n\nA nightmare unfolded in a part of the national capital in the early hours of Sunday when a four-storey building came crashing down like a stack of cards, killing eleven people and leaving as many injured.\n\nAround 3 am, the building in Mustafabad's Shakti Vihar collapsed, trapping several under the rubble. While eleven people were pulled out alive by rescue teams, eleven others were declared dead. All the rescued people were rushed to a nearby hospital, where five are undergoing treatment, while six have been discharged.\n\nUsing cranes and thermal cameras, rescue teams from Delhi Fire Services, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) and local volunteers have been working through the night.\n\nEven though the officials are yet to comment on the reason for the collapse, locals have alleged that a dividing wall on the ground floor of the building was removed without reinforcing the pillars, making it vulnerable.\n\nThe incident comes close on the heels of a building collapse in Madhu Vihar recently during a dust storm, killing one.\n\n“They should have checked the building. We kept saying it was shaking after the rain. But, nobody came,” said a local.\n\nSehjhad, who lost two nephews in the accident, said, “I've come from the hospital. The building was eight to ten years old. Pillar work was underway. The whole foundation gave way. Two school-going boys are gone. Everything — gold, cash — is under the rubble.”\n\nDelhi Minister Kapil Mishra has blamed the collapse on rampant illegal construction in unauthorised colonies. “All such colonies are unauthorised. We will act against the MCD (Municipal Corporation of Delhi) officials who cleared these houses.”\n\nChief Minister Rekha Gupta has assured strict action against the culprits. \"Strict action will be taken against the culprits. Investigations have been ordered,\" she posted on X.",

    "content": "New Delhi:\n\nA 34-year-old man from Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad in a suicide bid consumed poison and died two days later at a local hospital during treatment. Mohit Tyagi, employed with a private firm and a resident of Ghaziabad's Modinagar area, accused his wife and her relatives of harassment in a suicide note.\n\nMohit's brother, Rahul Tyagi, has claimed that he had been under psychological stress due to alleged mistreatment by his wife and her family. The family filed a complaint at the Modinagar police station, naming Mohit's wife Priyanka Tyagi, her brother Puneet Tyagi, sister-in-law Neetu Tyagi, and maternal uncles Anil and Vishesh Tyagi.\n\nA case has been registered and an investigation into the circumstances around Mohit's death, police said.\n\nBackground\n\nMohit married Priyanka, a woman from Sambhal district, on December 10, 2020. This was Mohit's second marriage. The couple had a son, Samarth Tyagi (nicknamed Chiku), in October 2021.\n\nAccording to Mohit's family, the relationship began deteriorating within months of the marriage. Allegations include regular verbal abuse, threats of false legal action, and emotional and psychological harassment. Mohit's suicide letter, shared with several friends and relatives on WhatsApp shortly before he consumed poison on April 15, explicitly names individuals he believed were responsible for his mental anguish.\n\nIn the letter, he accuses his wife and her relatives of marrying him under a plan to extract money through threats of false legal action, including a dowry case.\n\nAlleged Gold Theft\n\nTensions between Mohit and Priyanka escalated in August 2024, following the death of Mohit's mother due to blood cancer. Mohit alleged that three months after his mother's death, Priyanka, accompanied by her brother and another unidentified person, took away all gold jewellery in the house - estimated to be worth between Rs 12 to Rs 15 lakhs - as well as cash stored in the family locker. She also left with their child, Samarth.\n\nThis incident allegedly occurred when Mohit was about to leave for work. His sister-in-laws were at home and notified his elder brother, Rahul, who arrived shortly after. Attempts to stop Priyanka were allegedly met with threats. According to the letter, she said she would defame the family if she were not allowed to leave.\n\nThe family claimed they had filed a police complaint at the time, but no action was taken.\n\nThe Trigger and Suicide\n\nOn April 15, Mohit allegedly received a phone call from the Chowda police station in Sambhal. The call informed him of a complaint lodged by his wife. Shortly after, he messaged his acquaintances through WhatsApp, indicating that he was going to take his life and naming those he held responsible.\n\nHe consumed poison that day and was initially admitted to a local hospital in Modinagar. His condition worsened and he died two days later.\n\n\"I and my family members kept trying my best to change Priyanka's behavior, but it seemed as if she had married me for some other purpose, because from the way she behaved, anyone could guess that she had come not to get married but to extort a good amount of money from me and my family members or to trap me in a false case,\" Mohit claimed.\n\nThe Suicide Letter\n\nIn the letter, Mohit alleged that Priyanka repeatedly attempted to terminate her pregnancy, prompting multiple hospital admissions in Modinagar, Meerut, and Ghaziabad. Mohit claimed that Priyanka expressed a lack of desire to raise the child, both before and after birth.\n\nAfter childbirth, her behaviour allegedly became more hostile, and she continued to verbally abuse him and his family. Mohit and his family feared arrest and social ostracisation from what he called a false legal case.\n\nMohit expressed concern for the welfare of his son, asking that the child be placed under the care of his paternal family.\n\n\"I have no grief over dying, I am just sad that after my death, all these conspirators may kill my child Chiku,\" he said. \"If I do not commit suicide, no one will believe my truth.\"\n\nThe letter ends with an appeal to the UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, urging him to deter the misuse of legal provisions in matrimonial disputes.",

    "content": "New Delhi:\n\n'Lady don' Zikra, who was arrested by Delhi Police in connection with the murder of a 17-year-old boy in Delhi's Seelampur area, was sent to two days' police custody on Saturday.\n\nThe Delhi Police told the court they needed her custody to arrest the other accused and to recover the weapon used in the crime.\n\nAccording to the police, Zikra's cousins, Sahil and Dilshad, attacked the boy, Kunal, with knives. Both accused are still on the run, and the police are searching for them.\n\nDuring questioning, Zikra told the police that her cousin Sahil was attacked in November last year by two boys, Lala and Shambhu, who were friends of Kunal. Kunal was also present at the time, but since he was a minor, his name was not mentioned in the FIR.\n\nZikra and Sahil believed that Kunal was responsible for the attack, so they decided to take revenge.\n\nThe Delhi Police have formed ten teams to trace and arrest the other accused. Officers are scanning CCTV footage to track their escape routes and are conducting raids in different parts of Delhi.\n\nEarlier, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said that justice would be served in the case of the 17-year-old boy who was stabbed to death and later declared dead at Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital.\n\n\"I have spoken to the Police commissioner on the murder of a 17-year-old boy, Kunal. He was attacked with knives and was rushed to the Jai Prakash hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival,\" Gupta told reporters.\n\nMeanwhile, the victim's mother said she had not received any updates from the police and accused the authorities of helping the culprits escape.\n\nThe murdered teenager, identified as Kunal, was killed in the J Block area of Seelampur.",

    "content": "A Zomato delivery agent's unconventional approach to securing a marketing internship has gone viral on LinkedIn. It all started after a customer shared a photograph of a handwritten note received with the food order.\n\nThe note, written by the delivery partner, read, “I am a college student looking for a summer internship in marketing (NOT sales). Do contact me. 6261724837 (Only WhatsApp).”\n\nOn the reverse side of the paper, the delivery agent had added an apology for the “terrible handwriting.”\n\nThe note was shared by an employee at shopflo, a technology company. The person had placed the order during a late work shift. “Along with the food came a handwritten letter from the delivery partner,” the post read.\n\nThe user added, “That note hit me. Amidst the hustle of deliveries, this person still took a shot at reaching out — handwritten, bold, and hopeful.”\n\nThe delivery agent's request, which was directed specifically towards marketing opportunities and not sales roles, stood out for its clarity.\n\nThe user added, “It reminded me how opportunities don't always come through formal channels — sometimes, they're scribbled on paper in the middle of a delivery run.”\n\nThe post concluded with a message of encouragement for the delivery partner, stating, “If someone from the marketing space comes across this and sees potential in him, I truly hope this note finds the right eyes.”\n\nHere's the complete post:\n\nMany LinkedIn users have since expressed support and appreciation for the delivery partner's effort.\n\n“Stories like this show how creative hustle makes all the difference~ struggles of marketing students!” read a comment.\n\nA person suggested that by working on the ground with Zomato, the delivery agent is gaining real-world marketing experience that could be more valuable than a traditional internship or corporate job.\n\n“The team at ‘Eternal/Zomato' led by Deepinder Ji is among India's leading authorities in marketing. He is working with them, and instead of copying and pasting at labs, he is running in real time on the ground. Simply seeing daily operations puts him much beyond any walled square laboratory,” wrote the user.\n\nAnother comment, from a “college student,” reflected admiration for the delivery agent's unconventional approach to seeking an internship. “It's not easy to put yourself out there like that, especially in such an unconventional way. Huge respect to the delivery partner for being bold and creative!”\n\nA user praised the delivery agent's willingness to take a chance despite uncertain outcomes.\n\nAt a time when opportunity often hinges on visibility, this delivery partner's gesture is a reminder that a simple nudge, even handwritten, can go a long way.",

The company stated that the bot will leverage users' \"preferences and interests to make it even more helpful for writing, getting advice, learning, and beyond\".\n\nIn addition to the saved memories, ChatGPT can also reference users' past chats to deliver responses that feel noticeably more relevant and useful.\n\nAt the time, users expressed concerns over the potential of a chatbot retaining all the data and its possible misuse by the company. However, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman released a statement, clarifying that users can \"opt out of this, or memory altogether\" if they want.",

    "content": "New Delhi:\n\nThe Thackeray family - which splintered politically in 2005 following Raj Thackeray's decision to start his own party, could witness a dramatic reunion. Estranged cousins Raj and Uddhav Thackeray have both hinted at a patch-up amid concerns over alleged threats to Marathi identity and culture.\n\nSpeaking at different events, the two leaders, who head the Shiv Sena (UBT) and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) respectively, conveyed a common message that Maharashtra's linguistic and cultural interests are above political rivalries.\n\nAsked about the possibility of a reunion between the cousins during a podcast with actor-filmmaker Mahesh Manjrekar, Raj Thackeray said that the differences between him and his cousins are proving detrimental to Maharashtra's interests.\n\n\"The disputes and fights between Uddhav and me are minor -- Maharashtra is much bigger than all that. These differences are proving costly for the existence of Maharashtra and the Marathi people. Coming together is not difficult, it's a matter of will. It's not just about my desire or selfishness. We need to look at the bigger picture. All Marathi people across political parties should unite and form a single party,\" Raj Thackeray said.\n\nHowever, Raj Thackeray stressed the difference between his earlier departure from Shiv Sena in 2005 from the 2022 split led by Eknath Shinde, who broke away from Uddhav Thackeray's faction to form a new government with the BJP.\n\n\"I left Shiv Sena when MLAs and MPs were with me. Even then, I chose to walk alone because I couldn't work under anyone except Balasaheb Thackeray. I had no objection to working with Uddhav,\" he said. \"The question is - does the other side have the will to work with me?\"\n\n\"If Maharashtra wants us to come together, let Maharashtra speak up,\" he added. \"I don't let my ego get in the way of such matters.\"\n\nUddhav Thackeray, addressing a gathering organised by the Bhartiya Kamgar Sena, expressed a conditional openness to reconciliation.\n\n\"I'm ready to put aside petty disputes. I appeal to all Marathi people to unite in the interest of Maharashtra. But there is a condition -- when we pointed out in Parliament that industries were being shifted to Gujarat, if we had united then, we could have formed a government that worked for Maharashtra. We cannot keep switching sides -- supporting them one day, opposing them the next, and then compromising again,\" Uddhav Thackeray.\n\n\"Anyone who acts against Maharashtra's interests -- I will not welcome them, invite them home, or sit with them. Let this be clear first, and then let us work together for Maharashtra,\" he added.\n\nCommon Opposition To Policy Change\n\nThe remarks come at a time when both leaders have expressed opposition to the Maharashtra government's decision to make Hindi a compulsory subject from Classes 1 to 5 in all Marathi and English-medium schools. The policy, initiated by the BJP-led MahaYuti government, has been viewed by both parties as an affront to the Marathi language.\n\nUddhav and Raj Thackeray independently denounced the policy, arguing it undermines Marathi's cultural standing, particularly ironic at a time when the BJP government has granted classical language status to Marathi.\n\n\"If you are going to make Hindi compulsory, then I want to tell [Devendra] Fadnavis to make Marathi compulsory in Ghatkopar. We don't oppose any other language,\" said Uddhav Thackeray, referencing Ghatkopar, a Gujarati-dominated locality in central Mumbai.\n\n\"We want to make everyone ours. There are North Indians, Gujaratis, and now Muslims are also with us, but why do you want to disunite us? Try doing this in Tamil Nadu in front of MK Stalin. We have nothing against Hindi. But why make it compulsory?\" he asked.\n\nRaj Thackeray, weighing in on the Hindi language row, posted on social media on Friday that his party will categorically \"not accept\" the mandatory Hindi language in the state school syllabus.\n\n\"The Central government is currently making efforts to 'Hindify' everywhere, and neither will it allow us to be successful in the state. Hindi is not the national language,\" he wrote.",

    "content": "Fatima Hassouna, a 25-year-old Palestinian photojournalist from Gaza, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on April 16. Ms Hassouna, who had spent the last 18 months chronicling the war around her, was killed just days before she was to be married.\n\nThe strike, which hit her home in northern Gaza, also claimed the lives of 10 members of her family, including her pregnant sister, according to The Guardian.\n\nMs Hassouna had long been aware of the risks of her work and the dangers of existing in a conflict zone. Yet, she chose to face them head-on, determined that her story — and those of her people — would be heard.\n\nAccording to a report in CNN, Ms Hassouna, in an Instagram post in August 2024, said, “If I die, I want a resounding death, I do not want me in urgent news, nor a number with a group.”\n\nShe added, “I want a death that the world hears, an effect that remains for the extent of the ages, and immortal images that neither time nor space buries.”\n\nLife Spent Behind The Lens\n\nMs Hassouna's body of work captured the harsh realities of life in Gaza, from the aftermath of airstrikes to moments of resilience in the face of devastation. Her photographs, shared widely on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook, depicted both suffering and defiance.\n\nShe continued to work even after her home was destroyed, even after 11 members of her extended family had been killed in previous attacks. According to CNN, her parents survived the latest strike but are now in critical condition and receiving treatment in intensive care.\n\nHamza Hassouna, Fatima Hassouna's cousin, recounted the incident in an interview with CNN on April 18.\n\n“I was sitting when suddenly two rockets fell, one next to me and one in the living room. The house fell on us, and everything was a disaster,” he said.\n\nThe Israeli Response\n\nThe Israeli military confirmed the airstrike but stated that it was a targeted attack on a Hamas operative. In a statement published on April 16, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the target was “a terrorist in Hamas' Gaza City Brigade” and claimed measures had been taken to minimise civilian casualties, reported The Guardian.\n\nThe impact of the attack has drawn condemnation from press freedom groups.\n\nOutcry From Journalist Associations\n\nThe Palestinian Journalists' Protection Center (PJPC) described the strike as a “crime” against journalists and a violation of international law.\n\nIn a statement, as reported by CNN, the centre said, “Fatima's powerful photos documenting life under siege were published globally, shedding light on the human toll of the war.”\n\nThe PJPC further noted that the location of the strike — her family home on Al-Nafaq Street in Gaza City — suggested a targeted hit that endangered not just her life, but that of her entire family.\n\nA Voice For Gaza In Life And Film\n\nMs Hassouna's work and voice were set to reach an even wider audience with the upcoming release of a documentary about her life. The film, Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk, directed by Iranian filmmaker Sepideh Farsi, was to be screened at an independent French film festival running parallel to the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe film documents the reality of daily life in Gaza through a series of video exchanges between Sepideh Farsi and Ms Hassouna. “She became my eyes in Gaza…fiery and full of life. I filmed her laughs, her tears, her hopes and her depression,” Ms Farsi told Deadline, as cited by The Guardian.\n\nMs Farsi, who lives in exile in France, said she was devastated by the news of Hassouna's death. “She was such a light, so talented. When you see the film, you'll understand,” she was quoted as saying.\n\nMs Farsi had spoken to Fatima Hassouna only hours before her death, inviting her to attend the film screening in Cannes.\n\n“We both discussed her travelling to France in May to present the documentary in Cannes with me, since she is the main protagonist,” Ms Farsi told CNN. “I thought it was a mistake when I heard about her death.”\n\nFollowing the news of her death, Sepideh Farsi shared a photo of the two of them on Facebook.\n\n“My last image of her is a smile. I cling to it today,” she wrote alongside the picture.\n\nFatima Hassouna's last post on Facebook, uploaded less than a week before her death, featured a series of photographs of Gaza's fishermen by the sea, accompanied by a short poem.",

CCTV in an adjacent alley has captured the moment the building collapsed. The footage showed a sudden spark and a thick cloud of dust filling the alley, preventing any further recording.\n\nThe collapse occurred early Saturday morning. Various rescue agencies - including the National Disaster Response Force and the Delhi Fire Services - have been deployed amid fears that many are still trapped under the rubble.\n\nEleven people died, and the rescuers found 14 survivors so far, while 8-10 people are still feared trapped, said a senior police officer. The injured survivors are being treated at the GTB hospital.\n\nDivisional Fire Officer Rajendra Atwal said they received the call about the collapse around 2:50 am. When the fire officials reached there, they found the entire building had collapsed and some were trapped, he said.\n\nAn official from the NDRF described it as a “pancake collapse” (in which a structure collapses vertically) and said the chances of survival are minimal. But we are clearing the debris and thoroughly checking for any life that can be saved, said the official. Space constraints in the congested area are limiting the use of heavy machines and posing a challenge to the rescue operation, he added.\n\nThe collapse occurred hours after the city witnessed heavy downpour accompanied by strong winds and thunderstorms. Officials, however, said the cause of the collapse is still being investigated.\n\nA man who lost his two nephews in the collapse said his sister, brother-in-law and niece were injured and admitted to the hospital. Another man who lives in the area said he has not seen his neighbours since the collapse. The family had at least eight members, and he could spot no one since.",

    "content": "There are so many little fears attached to travelling, from the classic “did I pack enough clothes?” panic to worrying about missed flights, delays, or sitting next to a stranger who would not stop talking. But did you know Jennifer Aniston also has a big travelling fear? The F.R.I.E.N.D.S star recently shared “extreme fear of flying.” In a conversation with Travel + Leisure, Jennifer shared that while she absolutely loves being near “a white sandy beach and clear, crystal blue water,” getting on a plane to reach those places has never been easy. The actress stated that, for years, she relied on some quirky habits to calm her nerves – like tapping the outside of the plane with her right hand and stepping in with her right foot. “I used to be superstitious,” she said.\n\nAlso Read: Acclaimed British-Indian Travel Author Bill Aitken Dies At 90\n\nBut these days, Jennifer Aniston is trying a new approach: hypnosis. Yes, you read that right. “I have been doing some hypnosis lately, and one of the requirements is to remove all of those superstitions,” she said. And surprisingly, it's been working. “I have not been doing the right hand, right foot — and now it's shockingly good!” The actress also mentioned that she has found comfort in guided meditations during takeoff. And while we are on the topic of travel quirks, Jennifer also admitted she is a classic over-packer. “You just don't know where you're going to be on a certain day, or what mood you're going to be in,” she said. The actress also shared how friends “really appreciate” all the extra outfits she brings, since they end up borrowing from her suitcase.\n\nAlso Read: This Pristine Meghalaya Village Delighted Sachin Tendulkar - What You Should Know\n\nJust like Jennifer Aniston, are you also scared of flying? Here are five simple things you should follow:\n\n1. Know What's Going On\n\nSometimes, fear comes from not knowing what is happening. Read a bit about how flying works – like how turbulence is normal and planes are built to handle it. A little knowledge can really calm the mind.\n\n2. Distract Yourself\n\nBring things that keep you busy music, movies, books, podcasts, or even games. Time flies (pun intended) when you are having fun. The goal is to focus on something other than the fact that you are in the air.\n\n3. Breathe Easy\n\nFeeling anxious? Take a few slow, deep breaths. Inhale through your nose, hold for a second and exhale through your mouth. It sounds simple, but it really helps your body relax.\n\n4. Talk To The Crew\n\nFlight attendants deal with nervous flyers all the time. Do not be shy to let them know you are scared. They are super kind and can help reassure you.\n\n5. Fly More\n\nWeird tip, right? But the more you fly, the less scary it becomes. It is like facing your fear and proving to yourself that you can do it.",

    "content": "OpenAI's recently launched o3 and o4-mini AI models are prone to hallucinations, more often than the company's previous reasoning models, a report in TechCrunch has claimed. The ChatGPT creators launched the models on Wednesday (Apr 16), which are designed to pause and work through questions before responding.\n\nHowever, as per OpenAI's internal tests, the two new models are hallucinating or making things up much more frequently than even the non-reasoning models, such as GPT-4o. The company does not have an idea why this is happening.\n\nIn a technical report, OpenAI said \"more research is needed\" to understand why hallucinations are getting worse as it scales up reasoning models.\n\n\"Our hypothesis is that the kind of reinforcement learning used for o-series models may amplify issues that are usually mitigated (but not fully erased) by standard post-training pipelines,\" a former OpenAI employee was quoted as saying by the publication.\n\nExperts claim that while hallucinations may help the models develop creative and interesting ideas, they could also make it a tough sell for businesses in a market where accuracy is the paramount benchmark to achieve.\n\nOpenAI has been betting heavily on the new models to beat the likes of Google, Meta, xAI, Anthropic, and DeepSeek in the cutthroat global AI race. As per the Sam Altman-led company, o3 achieves state-of-the-art performance on SWE-bench verified -- a test measuring coding abilities, scoring 69.1 per cent. Meanwhile, the o4-mini model achieves similar performance, scoring 68.1 per cent.\n\nAlso Read | Can US Manipulate Space And Time?

There is no food. So (turtle meat) is an alternative for other sources of protein. There is no meat, poultry or vegetables.\"\n\nThe UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has warned that Gaza is facing its most severe humanitarian crisis since the war began on October 7, 2023, triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel.\n\nFighting has raged in Gaza since then, pausing only twice -- recently during a two-month ceasefire between January 19 and March 17, and in a previous one-week halt in late November 2023.\n\nThe World Health Organization's regional chief Hanan Balkhy said in June that some Gazans were so desperate that they were eating animal food, grass, and drinking sewage water.\n\nHamas on Thursday accused Israel of using \"starvation as a weapon\" against Gazans by blocking aid supplies.\n\nFisherman Qanan said the turtles were killed in the \"halal\" method, in accordance with Islamic rites.\n\n\"If there was no famine, we would not eat it and leave it, but we want to compensate for the lack of protein,\" he said.",

    "link": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/cannabis-as-cancer-treatment-new-study-reveals-promising-results-8202569#publisher=newsstand",
    "content": "A new study has uncovered significant evidence supporting the use of medical cannabis in cancer treatment. The study suggests medical cannabis may not only alleviate symptoms but also combat the disease itself.\n\nPublished recently in Frontiers in Oncology, the study tries to establish a scientific consensus on the role of cannabis in cancer care.\n\nRyan Castle, research director at the Whole Health Oncology Institute and the lead author of the study, explained that the objective of this analysis was to address the ongoing debate by gathering and evaluating a vast array of studies.\n\n“Our goal was to determine the scientific consensus on the topic of medical cannabis, a field that has long been dominated by a war between cherry-picked studies,” Castle was quoted as saying by The Guardian.\n\nThe research, which was funded by Cancer Playbook, a collaborative effort with the Whole House Oncology Institute to collect and analyse patient-reported data, is based on a review of over 10,000 studies related to medical cannabis and cancer. This huge pool of research reportedly surpasses the scale of any previous study in the field.\n\nDespite limitations imposed by the restricted legal status of cannabis, which has hampered direct clinical studies on humans, the researchers used a broad spectrum of observational and laboratory-based studies. These include animal trials and cell research exploring the effects of cannabis on tumour growth.\n\nCastle's team endeavoured to incorporate as many of these studies as possible to ensure a comprehensive review.\n\nCastle said, “To move beyond bias–conscious or not–it was essential to use a large-scale, radically inclusive methodology based on mathematical reasoning.”\n\nThe analysis showed a clear pattern. It identified studies with positive, neutral and negative views on cannabis's impact on cancer symptoms, such as appetite loss, inflammation and even the process of tumour cell death, known as apoptosis.\n\nThe findings were striking, especially regarding cannabis's ability to address symptoms like nausea and appetite loss. The study's most remarkable discovery was cannabis's potential to directly target cancer cells, with evidence suggesting it may inhibit their spread and promote cell death.\n\nAlthough cannabis' potential as a cancer treatment has been met with some scepticism, especially due to concerns over its links to substance use disorders, the research has received both support and criticism.\n\nOncologist Donald Abrams, a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Francisco, questioned the validity of these findings.\n\nAbrams, who has had extensive experience treating cancer patients in San Francisco, noted the therapeutic value of cannabis in managing cancer symptoms, including pain, nausea, and anxiety. But he expressed doubt about cannabis's ability to cure cancer, stating, “If cannabis cures cancer, I have not been able to appreciate that,” he told Guardian\n\nCastle, though, is optimistic, citing both the pre-clinical evidence and encouraging patient outcomes as reasons to believe in cannabis's cancer-fighting potential.\n\nHe hopes that this meta-analysis will prompt the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to reconsider the federal classification of cannabis, thereby removing the current research restrictions.",

    "content": "A Bengaluru-based man has shared a post on LinkedIn about the challenges of raising daughters in India, highlighting gender bias and the everyday lessons he's learned through parenthood. Ajit Sivaram started his post by stating, “Raising daughters in India is a revolution disguised as parenthood.”\n\nHe then painted a vivid picture of his daughters' morning routine, writing, “Every morning, I watch my girls put on their uniforms, pack their dreams, and step into a world that wasn't built for them. A world that will question their ambition, police their laughter, and measure their worth by their silence.\"\n\nThen from that simple image, he goes on to reflect on how raising girls in a traditionally patriarchal society has reshaped his understanding of leadership, empathy and responsibility. “Raising daughters in India means confronting bias before breakfast,” he added.\n\nThe post then touches on personal moments, such as fielding questions from relatives “about not having a son,” or seeing how neighbours assign different conversations to him and his wife based on gendered expectations. He revealed that his neighbours, “speak to my wife about ballet and to me about science projects.”\n\nMr Sivaram pointed out how this everyday experience has sharpened his awareness of workplace inequality.\n\n“When I visit clients' offices, I now see the women who are interrupted in meetings. The ideas that are attributed to the wrong people. The invisible labour that keeps teams functioning but receives no credit. I see it because I've watched it happen to two little girls I love more than life,” he said.\n\nInstead of framing himself as a hero, he identified as an ally - someone learning, unlearning, and growing through the lens of parenthood.\n\nHe stated, “Leadership isn't learned in boardrooms. It's learned at dinner tables where you must explain why ‘girls don't do that' is a lie wrapped in tradition. It's learned when your 7-year-old asks why that uncle said women should act ‘appropriately' and you have to dismantle centuries of patriarchy before bedtime.”\n\nTowards the end of his post, he shared a powerful reflection.\n\nHe wrote, “Because every night, I go home to two girls who ask me about my day. And in their eyes, I see the question they're really asking: ‘Did you make the world a little better for us today?'”\n\nHe added, “Some days I can say yes.

    "content": "Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, a close associate of US President Donald Trump, has shared his plans for visiting India. Talking about his phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday, he said that he is looking forward to visiting India later this year.\n\n\"It was an honour to speak with PM Modi. I am looking forward to visiting India later this year,\" said Musk on X, a day after holding talks about India-US collaborations with the Prime Minister.\n\nPM Modi said yesterday that the two covered various issues during their phone call. These included topics that featured in their discussions when PM Modi visited Washington earlier this year, like space, mobility, and technology.\n\n\"We discussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation. India remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the US in these domains,\" PM Modi had said.\n\nElon Musk, who calls himself a “fan” of PM Modi, had been planning to visit India. One such plan last year had to be postponed due to “very heavy Tesla obligations”. Delaying his trip, the world's richest man had said he would visit India later in 2024. But that plan didn't work out either.\n\nThe Elon Musk-PM Modi phone call assumes significance since it comes at a time the US and China are engaged in a fierce trade war, with the leaders on both sides, Trump and Xi Jinping, being defiant and unrelenting.\n\nBesides the US economy, Musk has specific business interests in India. This includes the foray of his electric car brand Tesla into Indian markets and the operations of satellite-based Starlink internet. India and the US are now working towards a mutually beneficial trade deal that Tesla hopes to ride on. Better tariffing could also make the electric cars get a better deal in a competitive market like India's.\n\nTesla has already started expanding into India, scouting for locations and employees. It has reportedly rented a 4,000 sq ft space in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex that comes with some parking slots. Reports suggest Tesla has also selected some additional space in Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nIndia leads the world in internet consumption and is a booming market for social media and fintech sectors. This makes India a potential market for Starlink. The company is now trying to overcome the regulatory challenges and security concerns to make their India plans come true.\n\nUnion Minister Piyush Goyal held a meeting with top Starlink executives in Delhi this week to discuss their investment plans for India.",

    "title": "This Northeast Indian Destination Is The World's First Fully Organic State: Here's Why",
    "link": "https://www.ndtv.com/travel/sikkim-the-worlds-first-fully-organic-state-8202674#publisher=newsstand",
    "content": "Tucked away in the northeast corner of India, bordered by Bhutan, Tibet and Nepal, Sikkim has long been one of the country's best-kept secrets. But this tiny Himalayan state is quietly leading a global movement — and now it's turning heads for more than just its jaw-dropping landscapes. In 2016, Sikkim made headlines for becoming the world's first fully organic state. That's right, every farm, field and vegetable patch across its 7,096 square kilometres is free from chemical fertilisers and pesticides. So what does that mean for travellers? Quite a lot, actually. The state's commitment to clean, green living isn't just good for the environment — it's creating a new kind of tourism that feels refreshingly authentic.\n\nHere's All About Sikkim, The World's First Fully Organic State:\n\n1. Where 'Green' Is A Lifestyle\n\nUnlike the typical tourist traps, Sikkim offers a slow, sustainable way to see the world. Think: locally grown food, traditional homestays, forest hikes, and community-led travel experiences. The shift to 100% organic farming has transformed daily life here. From farm-to-table meals to eco-conscious markets, the ethos of sustainability isn't just a marketing gimmick — it's built into the DNA of the place.\n\nWhether you're sipping on freshly brewed Temi tea, picked from the state's organic tea garden, or tucking into a home-cooked meal of nettle soup and millet pancakes in a village guesthouse, there's a sense of purity in everything you eat. And in a world obsessed with labels, Sikkim doesn't just talk the talk. It's certified.\n\nAlso Read: 8 Incredible Treks In Northeast India That Feel Almost Unreal\n\n2. How Sikkim Pulled It Off\n\nLet's rewind. The organic shift didn't happen overnight. The state government started the process back in 2003, slowly phasing out chemical inputs and training thousands of farmers in organic practices. By 2015, over 75,000 hectares of farmland had been converted. The transition earned Sikkim the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's Future Policy Gold Award in 2018, recognising it as a global pioneer in agroecology. And here's the thing: people noticed. From agri-tourism enthusiasts to conscious travellers, the movement has sparked a new kind of wanderlust — one rooted in clean eating, community connection, and environmental respect.\n\n3. Where To Go And What To Do In Sikkim\n\nYumthang Valley. Photo: iStock\n\nWhile most people fly into Bagdogra Airport and drive up to Gangtok, the state's capital, Sikkim really comes alive once you step off the tourist trail. Yuksom, in west Sikkim, is where the organic story begins. Surrounded by dense forest and backed by the mighty Khangchendzonga (India's highest peak), this village is full of history and clean air. Try a guided walk through organic farms, or stay in an eco-homestay that lets you join in seasonal farming activities.\n\nIf you're into food, head to Ravangla. The produce here is so fresh it's like a sensory wake-up call. Organic mushrooms, baby carrots, leafy greens and chillies are proudly displayed in tiny roadside stalls, and the locals are more than happy to tell you what's in season. For a deeper dive into sustainability, check out Dzongu, a restricted area that's home to the Lepcha community. Known for their deep respect for nature, Lepchas have embraced the organic lifestyle for generations. Permits are required, but the chance to see how traditional life blends seamlessly with modern eco — thinking is worth the extra effort. Or pick Yumthang Valley — nature sanctuary with river, hot springs, yaks, and grazing pasture on rolling meadows surrounded by the Himalayan mountains.\n\nAlso Read:Planning A Trip To Sikkim? Here Are The Details About New Tourist Entry Fee\n\n4. The Future Of Travel Is Organic\n\nWith climate change, food insecurity, and overtourism on everyone's radar, destinations like Sikkim offer a glimpse into a better way forward. And the best part? It's not trying to be trendy — it's just doing what feels right. So if your idea of a great holiday includes clean food, mountain views, meaningful conversations, and zero plastic bottles, Sikkim might just be your kind of place. It's not just India's first organic state — it's a travel experience that feeds your soul (and your gut) in the best way possible.",

    "content": "As Canada approaches its federal election on April 28, 2025, the nation's relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump has become a pivotal campaign issue. The four leading contenders for prime minister—Mark Carney, Pierre Poilievre, Jagmeet Singh, and Yves-François Blanchet—have each articulated distinct positions on Trump's policies and rhetoric. Here's an overview of their stances:\n\nMark Carney (Liberal Party)\n\nMark Carney, the interim Prime Minister and Liberal leader, has positioned himself as a steady hand capable of managing the challenges posed by Trump's administration.\n\nCarmey mentioned Trump often during the debate. “We can give ourselves far more than Donald Trump can ever take away,” he said, setting the tone for the debate. When asked about what he would do in a crisis, he said, “In a crisis, you got to plan for the worst, the worst is that the US actually does want to take us over,” referring to Trump's calls to make Canada the 51st state of the US.\n\nDuring the debate, he kept refocussing the attention on Trump even as Poilievre equated him with former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “The biggest risk we have to affordability, the biggest risk we have to this economy is Donald Trump, so first and foremost we've got to get that right.” he said.\n\nHe also added, \"[Trump] respects people who understand the world and how the private sector works”.\n\nEven his closing statement was about Trump. “They want our land, they want our resources, they want our water, they want our country. And we're all going to stand up against Donald Trump. I'm ready,” he said.\n\nPierre Poilievre (Conservative Party)\n\nConservative leader Pierre Poilievre has taken a firm stance against Trump's recent comments and trade policies. He has rejected comparisons to Trump, emphasising differences in their political positions, particularly on immigration and social programs.\n\nPoilievre has advocated for a “Canada First” approach, focusing on strengthening the Canadian economy through tax reductions and increased energy production.\n\nHe blamed Liberals for giving “Donald Trump and the US a near monopoly over our energy” by not building pipelines that could help export Canadian oil abroad.\n\nAlthough he has been compared to Trump because of his populist style of politics, he has said, \"I have a completely different story from Donald Trump”, with Trump himself saying that Poilievre is not “MAGA enough”. However, he has been praised by Tesla CEO and Trump ally Elon Musk.\n\nJagmeet Singh (New Democratic Party)\n\nNDP leader Jagmeet Singh has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump, particularly concerning issues of global stability and human rights. Singh has called for Trump to be disinvited from the upcoming G7 Summit in Canada, citing Trump's criminal conviction and actions that Singh believes threaten international cooperation.\n\n\"Why would we invite someone who threatens our sovereignty and economic well-being? Why would we invite someone who threatens the economic well-being of allies and threatens the world's stability? Why would we allow a convicted criminal into our country?\" Singh said in a statement.\n\nEven during the debate, Singh said, “I'm asking for your support in this election so that I can continue to fight to defend the things that make us Canada, the things that we hold dear, the things that make us proud to be Canadians”.\n\nSingh has also condemned Trump's trade policies, including auto tariffs, arguing that they harm Canadian workers and industries. He has urged the Canadian government to take a strong stand against such measures to protect national interests.\n\n“Trump's trade war is driving up costs for families while threatening thousands of good-paying jobs—but we won't let you pay the price,” Singh said. “We will fight like hell for your job, your wages, your home, your health care—and we'll build a Canada that puts working and middle-class people first.”\n\nYves-François Blanchet (Bloc Québécois)\n\nYves-François Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Québécois, has focused on defending Quebec's interests in the face of Trump's policies. He has criticised the U.S. administration's labeling of Quebec's Bill 96—a law promoting the French language—as a “foreign trade barrier.”\n\nBlanchet has called on the Canadian government to robustly defend Quebec's autonomy and cultural identity against external pressures.",

    "content": "New Delhi:\n\nIndia has issued a strong diplomatic rebuke to Bangladesh following the kidnapping and killing of Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a prominent Hindu minority leader in northern Bangladesh. In a sharply worded statement, New Delhi condemned the incident and accused the Muhammad Yunus-led Bangladeshi interim government of failing to protect its minority communities.\n\n\"We have noted with distress the abduction and brutal killing of Shri Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a Hindu minority leader in Bangladesh,\" the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. \"This killing follows a pattern of systematic persecution of Hindu minorities under the interim government even as the perpetrators of previous such events roam with impunity.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"We condemn this incident and once again remind the interim government to live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities, including Hindus, without inventing excuses or making distinctions.\"\n\nMr Roy, 58, was kidnapped from his home in Basudebpur village in Dinajpur district - located about 330 kilometres northwest of Dhaka -and later found dead. According to local media reports citing police and family members, Mr Roy received a phone call around 4:30 pm on Wednesday, believed to be from the men who would later attack him.\n\nAccording to a The Daily Star report, roughly thirty minutes after the call, four individuals arrived at Mr Roy's home on two motorcycles. They reportedly kidnapped him and took him to Narabari village, where he was assaulted. Family members told The Daily Star that Mr Roy was returned to his home in an unconscious state. He was transported to a hospital in Dinajpur, where he was declared dead on arrival.\n\nCongress vs BJP over Minority Rights\n\nCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge described Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent meeting with Muhammad Yunus as \"ineffective\" in securing protections for minorities.\n\n\"In Bangladesh, religious minorities, especially our Hindu brothers and sisters, are continuously facing atrocities,\" Mr Kharge said in a statement. \"The brutal murder of a prominent Hindu community leader, Mr Bhabesh Chandra Roy, is evidence that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cordial meeting with Bangladesh's Chief Advisor has failed.\"\n\nMr Kharge further cited Indian parliamentary data, stating that there had been 76 attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh in the past two months alone, resulting in 23 deaths. He also alleged that similar attacks on other religious minorities were ongoing.\n\nResponding to Mr Kharge's remarks, the BJP questioned why the Congress is silent on alleged attacks on Hindus in West Bengal, adding that foreign policy cannot be dictated by grudges but through diplomacy.\n\n\"The first thing Congress should do is realise that targeting PM Modi for his cordial ties with a global figure like Muhammad Yunus is absolutely absurd,\" BJP spokesperson Charu Pragya told NDTV. \"These connections serve India's interests in trade and regional security. You cannot define foreign policy on grudges. India's relationship is with the country of Bangladesh. Regimes can change. It is a bit childish of Congress to make irresponsible statements like that.\"\n\n\"Let me ask a question to Mr Kharge, why are you always silent on the plight of Hindus in your own country?\" she added.\n\nUS Travel Advisory For Bangladesh\n\nWith the country continuing to witness sporadic incidents of violence since former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster last year, the United States reissued a travel advisory to its citizens urging them to reconsider their plans to visit Bangladesh.\n\n\"Kidnappings have occurred in the region, including those motivated by domestic or familial disputes, and those targeting members of religious minorities. Separatist organisations and political violence also pose additional threats to visitors to the region, and there have been instances of IED explosions and active shooting,\" the advisory read.\n\n\"Prior approval from the Government of Bangladesh's Ministry of Home Affairs Office of Public Safety is required if you plan to travel to these areas. Due to the risks, US government employees working in Bangladesh are prohibited from traveling to the region,\" it added.",

    "content": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a resident of Maryland, finds himself at the heart of a contentious legal and diplomatic storm. He was deported to El Salvador despite court orders barring such a move.\n\nThe 28-year-old father of three, living in the United States for over a decade, was sent to El Salvador by the Donald Trump administration on allegations that he was affiliated with the notorious MS-13 gang. These claims, however, have never been substantiated in court, and no criminal charges have been brought against him in the US to date.\n\nAbrego Garcia now languishes in one of El Salvador's megaprison facilities, a situation US authorities have chalked up to an “administrative error.” His wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, along with his legal team, has denied all allegations, painting him instead as a devoted husband and hard-working sheet metal apprentice.\n\nEarly Life And Move To The US\n\nBorn in July 1995 in Los Nogales, El Salvador, Abrego Garcia grew up helping his family run a business making pupusa, a local delicacy, according to a report in NBC News. His early life was overshadowed by threats and extortion from local gang members. Seeking safety, he crossed the US border in 2012 at the age of 16 and eventually settled in Maryland with his brother, a US citizen.\n\nIt was in Maryland that Abrego Garcia built a life. He married a US citizen, raised three children (including two step children) and worked in the construction sector as a sheet metal apprentice, joining a local trade union.\n\nThe Arrest\n\nAbrego Garcia's troubles began in March 2019 when he was detained outside a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, along with three other men. Police labelled the group as loiterers and suspected gang affiliation based on their clothing and a “confidential source.” Although no criminal charges followed, these assumptions became the basis for the government's claims that Abrego Garcia was linked to MS-13.\n\nDocuments later revealed inconsistencies in how police documented the incident. His legal team insists that “there is no reliable evidence in the record to support” the claim of gang membership, calling the allegations hearsay derived from an unverified source.\n\nOne of the arresting officers, Ivan Mendez, was later removed from duty and convicted of misconduct in an unrelated case, further casting doubt on the credibility of the original gang allegations.\n\nA Judge's Protection Ignored\n\nDespite the accusations, a 2019 immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia protection from being deported to El Salvador, citing his “well-founded fear of future persecution” from local gangs, stated the NBC News report, He was granted withholding of removal, allowing him to stay in the US under strict conditions, including annual check-ins with immigration authorities.\n\nHis legal status meant he had the right to live and work in the US temporarily.\n\nOn March 15, 2025, Abrego Garcia was abruptly deported to El Salvador in violation of the standing court order. The administration has since argued that it lacks jurisdiction to bring him back now that he is outside the country, despite a federal judge — and later the Supreme Court — ordering them to “facilitate” his return and show evidence of such efforts.\n\nMeeting With US Senator\n\nAfter weeks of silence and mounting concern for his wellbeing, Abrego Garcia was briefly released from prison in El Salvador on April 17 to meet with US Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland.\n\n“His conversation with me was the first communication he'd had with anybody outside of prison since he was abducted. He said he felt very sad about being in a prison because he had not committed any crimes,” said Van Hollen.\n\nVan Hollen later described the deportation as an “illegal abduction,” and added that Abrego Garcia had “experienced trauma,” according to NBC News.\n\nShortly after the meeting, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele confirmed that Abrego Garcia would remain incarcerated, stating he had been examined and found to be in good health.\n\nAllegations Continue, But No Charges\n\nDespite the mounting scrutiny, the Department of Homeland Security has continued to release claims against Abrego Garcia. These include involvement in a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop that allegedly raised suspicions of human trafficking. No charges were filed, and law enforcement allowed him to leave. His wife has defended the incident, saying, “Kilmar worked in construction and sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites, so it's entirely plausible he would have been pulled over while driving with others in the vehicle.”\n\nAdding to the complexity, DHS also highlighted a temporary restraining order sought by his wife in 2021, which she later dropped. “No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect. That is not a justification for ICE's action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation,” she stated.\n\nFor now, Abrego Garcia remains behind bars in El Salvador, while legal battles continue in US courts. His wife and supporters are fighting to bring him home.",

    "link": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/israel-still-eyeing-limited-attack-on-irans-nuclear-facilities-report-8202317#publisher=newsstand",
    "content": "New York:\n\nIsrael has not ruled out an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities in the coming months despite President Donald Trump telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the US was for now unwilling to support such a move, according to an Israeli official and two other people familiar with the matter.\n\nIsraeli officials have vowed to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and Netanyahu has insisted that any negotiation with Iran must lead to the complete dismantling of its nuclear program.\n\nUS and Iranian negotiators are set for a second round of preliminary nuclear talks in Rome on Saturday.\n\nOver the past months, Israel has proposed to the Trump administration a series of options to attack Iran's facilities, including some with late spring and summer timelines, the sources said. The plans include a mix of airstrikes and commando operations that vary in severity and could set back Tehran's ability to weaponize its nuclear program by just months or a year or more, the sources said.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Wednesday that Trump told Netanyahu in a White House meeting earlier this month that Washington wanted to prioritize diplomatic talks with Tehran and that he was unwilling to support a strike on the country's nuclear facilities in the short term.\n\nBut Israeli officials now believe that their military could instead launch a limited strike on Iran that would require less US support. Such an attack would be significantly smaller than those Israel initially proposed.\n\nIt is unclear if or when Israel would move forward with such a strike, especially with talks on a nuclear deal getting started. Such a move would likely alienate Trump and could risk broader U.S. support for Israel.\n\nParts of the plans were previously presented last year to the Biden administration, two former senior Biden administration officials told Reuters. Almost all required significant US support via direct military intervention or intelligence sharing. Israel has also requested that Washington help Israel defend itself should Iran retaliate.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, the US National Security Council referred Reuters to comments Trump made on Thursday, when he told reporters he has not waved Israel off an attack but that he was not \"in a rush\" to support military action against Tehran.\n\n\"I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death,\" Trump said. \"That's my first option. If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran, and I think Iran is wanting to talk.\"\n\nThe Israeli prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A senior Israeli official told Reuters that no decision has been made yet on an Iranian strike.\n\nA senior Iranian security official said Tehran was aware of Israeli planning and that an attack would provoke \"a harsh and unwavering response from Iran.\"\n\n\"We have intelligence from reliable sources that Israel is planning a major attack on Iran's nuclear sites. This stems from dissatisfaction with ongoing diplomatic efforts regarding Iran's nuclear program, and also from Netanyahu's need for conflict as a means of political survival,\" the official told Reuters.\n\nBiden Administration Pushback\n\nNetanyahu received pushback from the Biden administration when he presented an earlier version of the plan. The former senior Biden officials said Netanyahu wanted the U.S. to take the lead on airstrikes but the Biden White House told Israel it did not believe a strike was prudent unless Tehran moved to accelerate its enrichment of nuclear material or expel inspectors from the country.\n\nThe Biden officials also questioned the extent to which Israel's military could effectively carry out such an attack.\n\nFormer officials and experts have long said that Israel would need significant U.S. military support - and weapons - to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities and stockpiles, some of which are in underground facilities.\n\nWhile the more limited military strike Israel is considering would require less direct assistance - particularly in the form of U.S. bombers dropping bunker-busting munitions that can reach deeply buried facilities - Israel would still need a promise from Washington that it would help Israel defend itself if attacked by Tehran in the aftermath, the sources said.\n\nAny attack would carry risks. Military and nuclear experts say that even with massive firepower, a strike would probably only temporarily set back a program the West says aims to eventually produce a nuclear bomb, although Iran denies it.\n\nIsraeli officials have told Washington in recent weeks that they do not believe US talks with Iran should move forward to the deal-making stage without a guarantee that Tehran will not have the ability to create a nuclear weapon.\n\n\"This can be done by agreement, but only if this agreement is Libyan style: They go in, blow up the installations, dismantle all of the equipment, under American supervision,\" Netanyahu said following his talks with Trump. \"The second possibility is ... that they (Iran) drag out the talks and then there is the military option.\"\n\nFrom Israel's perspective, this may be a good moment for a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.\n\nIran allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been hammered by Israel since the Gaza war began, while the Houthi movement in Yemen has been targeted by US airstrikes. Israel also severely damaged Iran's air defense systems in an exchange of fire in October 2024.\n\nA top Israeli official, speaking with reporters earlier this month, recognized there was some urgency if the goal was to launch a strike before Iran rebuilds its air defenses. But the senior official refused to state any timeline for possible Israeli action and said discussing this would be \"pointless\".",

    "content": "New Delhi:\n\nA powerful earthquake measuring 5.8 on the Richter scale struck Afghanistan on Saturday afternoon at 12:17 pm IST, as reported by the National Center for Seismology (NCS).\n\nThe quake's epicentre was located at 36.10 degrees North latitude and 71.20 degrees East longitude, with a depth of 130 kilometres.\n\nTremors from the earthquake were felt across several northern regions of India, including Jammu and Kashmir and the Delhi-NCR area.\n\nWhile there have been no immediate reports of damage or injuries, authorities are keeping a close watch on the situation.\n\nThe NCS confirmed the seismic activity via a post on social media platform X.\n\n\"EQ of M: 5.8, On: 19/04/2025 12:17:53 IST, Lat: 36.10 N, Long: 71.20 E, Depth: 130 Km, Location: Afghanistan,\" NCS said in a post on X.\n\nThis event follows a similar tremor that occurred earlier in the week. On Wednesday, a 5.6 magnitude earthquake was recorded in Afghanistan, with its epicentre approximately 164 km east of Baghlan.\n\nThe European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) initially reported the quake as 6.4 in magnitude but later revised it to 5.6.\n\nIn a related development, the Kishtwar region of Jammu & Kashmir also experienced a mild earthquake measuring 2.4 on the Richter scale on Wednesday morning around 5:14 AM IST.\n\nThe tremor occurred at a shallow depth of 5 kilometres.\n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) highlights that Afghanistan is extremely susceptible to natural hazards such as earthquakes, landslides, and seasonal floods.\n\nUNOCHA also pointed out that the frequent seismic activity in the region severely impacts already fragile communities, which have endured years of conflict and underdevelopment.\n\nThese conditions have significantly weakened their capacity to handle multiple crises at once. According to the Red Cross, Afghanistan has a long history of experiencing powerful earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush region, which is known for its intense geological activity and frequent tremors.\n\nThe country lies along several major fault lines where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet. One of these fault lines passes directly through Herat, increasing the area's risk of seismic events.",

    "content": "New Delhi:\n\nA top official from the Donald Trump administration told Harvard University that a controversial letter sent to the institution last week was issued without proper authorisation.\n\nThe letter, dated April 11 and attributed to the White House's task force on antisemitism, included what Harvard officials saw as a series of highly intrusive demands regarding the university's hiring practices, admissions procedures and academic curriculum, reported The New York Times.\n\nBelieving they had no alternative, the university publicly stated its intention to push back against the administration on April 14.\n\nThen, shortly after the university's announcement, a Donald Trump official contacted Harvard to claim that the letter had been sent in error. The official described the communication as “unauthorised,” The New York Times reported, citing two individuals with knowledge of the matter.\n\nAccording to three others briefed on the situation, the letter had been sent by Sean Keveney, the acting general counsel at the Department of Health and Human Services. Keveney is also a member of the antisemitism task force. While the contents of the letter were genuine, there appears to have been confusion within the administration over whether it was meant to be sent to Harvard at all, stated The New York Times report.\n\nSome in the White House believed the document had been dispatched prematurely, while others thought it was intended solely for internal circulation among task force members. Sources requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of internal discussions.\n\nThe timing of the letter significantly impacted the situation. At the time it arrived, Harvard had been engaged in what it saw as constructive dialogue with the task force over a two-week period. The university believed there was still room to avoid a public dispute with the US President. But the severity of the demands outlined in the letter led Harvard to conclude that reconciliation was unlikely.\n\nAs The New York Times noted, this incident set off “a tectonic battle between one of the country's most prestigious universities and a US President.\"",

She has been accused of allegedly urinating on multiple surfaces, including a Bible.\n\nKelli Tedford, the content creator, is already facing backlash for an earlier incident involving urination on grocery items.\n\nThe 24-year-old, known online by the alias Kinki Kelli, is accused of causing significant damage to a Marriott hotel room in Keene in January 2025.\n\nAccording to court documents, Kelli Tedford allegedly recorded herself urinating on a range of items, including an air conditioning unit, curtains, bedding, and the Bible provided in the room.\n\nAuthorities claim she also defecated on the floor and attempted to conceal the waste by placing it inside the toilet tank. As a result, she now faces five counts of criminal mischief, as shown in the filings, obtained by The Smoking Gun.\n\nThe latest charges come just weeks after Kelli Tedford was arrested in connection with a separate case involving a local supermarket. She allegedly filmed herself urinating on various products at the Monadnock Food Co-op, also in Keene, stated a report in The New York Post.\n\nThe act forced the store to discard around $1,500 worth of stock due to contamination and cleaning costs.\n\nThe grocery store was later compelled to issue a product recall, covering items such as organic quinoa, polenta, coconut shreds, cornmeal and raw walnuts. The Keene Police Department said at the time that Tedford's actions were captured on surveillance footage.\n\nFurther investigation reportedly led authorities to an online archive of videos dating as far back as 2021, in which Tedford allegedly performed similar acts in other public or commercial spaces.\n\n\"At this time, it appears likely that similar historic incidents occurred in Keene and surrounding communities where Tedford contaminated items and/or surfaces with urine,\" said the police, according to The New York Post report.\n\nKelli Tedford had already been charged with criminal mischief for the supermarket incident. She is expected to appear in court on May 8 to answer to all related charges stemming from both cases.",

She is currently pursuing a Bachelor's in English honours from Delhi's Hansraj College. However, despite her skills and grade, she is unable to land an internship. \"I'm a topper, and I am unable to get an internship,\" Ms Fareed wrote in her post, as she admitted it took her a while to accept that \"skills matter more than marks\".\n\n\"All my professors and teachers, and relatives said: focus on your studies! Padhai kaam aayegi, ye nhi! (Studies will help you, not all this),\" the Delhi University student wrote. However, in reality, she said that companies are not looking for students who can recite answers, as they are looking for those who can deliver work. \"Companies don't want to hire toppers with no skills besides rote learning, but people who are proficient in a skill with decent marks,\" she wrote.\n\n\"See,I'm not asking you to burn away your books and throw away your backpacks, all I'm asking you is to pick up a skill , practice it as a habit , master it and you will find immediate opportunities running after you!\" Ms Fareed added.\n\nTake a look at the post below:\n\nConcluding her post, Ms Fareed shared that she has 50+ certificates, 10+ medals and 10+ trophies, but \"not a single one helped me in my internship interviews\".\n\nSince being shared, Ms Fareed's post has gone viral, triggering a conversation about skills versus marks online. Some users also said that they related to her sentiment and shared their own journeys.\n\n\"Being a school or college topper might look good on paper, but in the real world, organizations value hands-on experience and practical skills far more than academic rankings,\" wrote one user.\n\n\"As a topper myself, nothing has proven to be more true than this. The education system itself is underprepared to prepare its kids for the professional world,\" commented another.\n\nAlso read | Australian CEO Faces Backlash For Bragging About First-Class Flight, He Reacts\n\n\"Marks in competitive exams do matter & help you get jobs, or at least help you get into the interview room for the job, rest obviously depends upon your attitude and skills. Marks till 12th standard do help you in some cases with brutal competition such as IIM/ MBB Interviews. So yes, good marks do matter. But what you offer at the table matters the most after shortlisting or getting the job,\" one user wrote.\n\n\"Yes, degrees and certificates matter in the beginning, especially for interviews, but in the long run, it's your skills that matter most. Unfortunately, schools and colleges still don't focus much on that,\" added another.",

So, the students started chewing gum and then used it to stick the paper to the windows.\n\nRemembering a terrifying moment, he said, \"The teacher was asking if any of us had tape to tape up some paper.

    "content": "New Delhi:\n\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi has opened up about the deeper motivations behind his political journey and spoke about drawing inspiration from his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru. Mr Gandhi emphasised that Nehru's pursuit of truth - and not power - drives him.\n\nIn a \"podcast-style conversation\" with Sandeep Dikshit, the Leader of the Opposition also reflected on family stories, personal practices, and the enduring legacy of leaders such as Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi, Dr BR Ambedkar, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.\n\n\"In this Podcast-style conversation with Sandeep Dikshit, I speak about what drives me--the pursuit of truth--and how that pursuit is inspired by my great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru. He wasn't just a politician. He was a seeker, a thinker, someone who walked into danger with a smile and came out stronger. His greatest legacy lies in his relentless pursuit of truth - a principle that shaped everything he stood for. He didn't teach us politics. He taught us to confront fear and stand for the truth. That need to seek, to question, to stay rooted in curiosity - it runs in my blood,\" the Congress MP said.\n\n\"My grandmother called him \"Papa\". She told me stories of how he nearly fell into a glacier in the mountains he loved, how animals were always part of our family, or how they never missed an hour of exercise. My mother still watches birds in the garden. I do judo. These aren't just hobbies - they're windows into who we are. We observe. We stay connected to the world around us. And what we carry most deeply is the instinct to face challenges with quiet strength,\" Mr Gandhi said.\n\nGreat leaders like Gandhi, Nehru, Ambedkar, Patel, and Bose taught: how to befriend fear. Not socialism, not politics--just courage, he said.\n\n\"Gandhi stood up to an empire with nothing but truth. Nehru gave Indians the courage to resist oppression and ultimately claim freedom. Any great human endeavour--science, art, resistance--it all begins with confronting fear. And if you're committed to non-violence, then truth is your only weapon. No matter what was done to them, they didn't budge from it. That's what made them great leaders,\" Mr Gandhi said.\n\nAsserting that true leadership stems from courage, curiosity, and compassion, he declared his unwavering commitment to stand for truth, \"no matter the cost,\" in an era where, he said, truth has become inconvenient.\n\n\"Whether I'm speaking to Bill Gates or Chetram Mochi, I meet them with the same curiosity. Because real leadership isn't about control, it's about compassion. And in today's India, where truth is inconvenient, I've made my choice. I'll stand for it. No matter the cost,\" he emphasised.",

Ms Randhawa's family has claimed that she was struck by a bullet when violence broke out between two groups in the port city of Hamilton.\n\n\"She had gone to Canada about two years ago for her studies and was heading out for her daily routine when the incident occurred. During a clash between two groups, gunfire erupted, and she was struck by a bullet, leading to her death,\" the family said in a statement.\n\nMs Randhawa's family, from Dhunda village in Tarn Taran district of Punjab, has appealed to the government to expedite the process of returning her body.\n\nThe Incident\n\nHamilton Police Service confirmed that Ms Randhawa was killed on the evening of April 17.

    "content": "Indian-British astrophysicist Dr Nikku Madhusudhan and his team at Cambridge University have identified potential signs of alien life on a distant planet called K2-18b. With the help of NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the team detected the presence of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) gases, which are particularly noteworthy as these are produced by the marine algae present in the ocean.\n\nWho is Dr Nikku Madhusudhan?\n\nBorn in 1980 in India, Dr Madhusudhan earned his B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, BHU, Varanasi. Later, he pursued his master's as well as a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 2009, his PhD thesis was about studying the atmospheres of planets outside our solar system, called extrasolar planets.\n\nAfter his PhD, he held several positions as a postdoctoral researcher at MIT, Princeton University, and Yale University, where he was a YCAA Prize Postdoctoral Fellow. In 2013, he joined the University of Cambridge and spent four years working as a university lecturer in astrophysics. He was promoted to Reader in Astrophysics and Exoplanetary Science in 2017. He currently serves as a professor of astrophysics and exoplanetary science.\n\nHe came up with the idea of hycean planets, which are thought to be the best class of planets to look for life. The atmosphere of the hycean planets is rich in hydrogen, and underneath it are oceans. His research includes studying their atmospheres, interiors and how they were formed. His work includes exploring Hycean worlds, Sub-Neptunes, and biosignatures. He also works on radiative transfer, planetary chemistry, and atmospheric retrieval methods for exoplanets with the help of HST, JWST, and large ground-based telescopes.\n\nIn 2012, he studied a planet called 55 Cancri e, which is bigger than Earth, and suggested it might have a carbon-rich interior. In 2014, he led a team that measured water levels in three hot Jupiters and found less water than expected. In 2017, he was a part of the team that detected titanium oxide in the atmosphere of the planet WASP-19b. In 2020, he studied K2-18b and found that water may exist on its surface.\n\nDr Madhusudhan has been recognised with several accolades, such as the EAS MERAC Prize in Theoretical Astrophysics (2019), the Pilkington Prize for Excellence in Teaching (2019), the IUPAP Young Scientist Medal in Astrophysics (2016), and the ASI Vainu Bappu Gold Medal (2014).",

Good marks are required for admission to higher educational institutions and can also influence the types of scholarship students can apply for.\n\nA good score in Class 12 can open doors to various professional courses and career paths, as it can indicate a student's potential for academic success.\n\nUttarakhand's Pithoragarh district has the highest pass percentage of 91.90 per cent.\n\nGirls Outperform Boys\n\nLike Class 10, it is a similar trend on Class 12 results too where girls secured a much better pass percentage - of 86.20 per cent - than boys (80.10 per cent).

These include radial roads connecting the Outer Ring Road (ORR) and the Regional Ring Roads (RRR).\n\nAccording to the Chief Minister's Office (CMO), the delegation led by the Chief Minister met JICA Senior Vice President Shohei Hara and other senior managers. The Chief Minister gave an overview of investor-friendly policies of his government, the attractiveness of Hyderabad as a global investment destination, and large-scale infrastructure projects being taken up in the city and its surroundings.\n\nThe Chief Minister informed the JICA team that the Metro Rail phase 2 project proposal, with an investment of Rs 24,269 crore as a joint venture project of the Central and the Telangana governments, is under active consideration of the Central government.\n\nThe Telangana government is keen on JICA support for the 48 per cent loan component of the project, which is about Rs 11,693 crore. Revanth Reddy also stressed that the Indian government's foreign debt funding norms were being followed strictly by the state government.\n\nExplaining his vision for Hyderabad city to be developed on a par with global cities like New York and Tokyo, the Chief Minister urged JICA to consider funding the Musi rejuvenation project and the new radial roads as well.\n\nCiting the long-standing relationship between JICA and the Telangana government, JICA Senior Vice President Hara requested Mr Reddy to pursue the Metro Rail and other eligible projects with the Centre for JICA's support.\n\nThe delegation also met senior leadership of Marubeni Corporation, a leading Japanese industrial conglomerate with interests in energy, transport, real estate, industrial infra, metals, medical services, trading, etc.\n\nFollowing discussions, Marubeni Corp conveyed their interest to establish a state-of-the-art next-generation industrial park in the upcoming Future City near Hyderabad.

    "content": "A 34-year-old American man who spent the last 15 years practising martial arts and Taoism in China has been granted foreign permanent residency, according to the South China Morning Post (SCMP). Jake Pinnick from Illinois arrived in China in 2010 at the age of 20. Since then, he has dedicated himself to learning martial arts and Taoism at China's Wudang Mountain. His commitment has now been rewarded with a coveted Foreign Permanent Resident ID Card - widely known as the \"five-star card\".\n\n\"Congratulations! Jake Pinnick from Kewanee, Illinois, a 16th-generation disciple of the Wudang Sanfeng martial arts lineage, has got the Foreign Permanent Resident ID Card in China!\" said Xie Fengon, China's ambassador to the United States. \"The young man who came to China to pursue his Kung Fu dream at 20 is now a real master!\" Mr Fengon added.\n\nAccording to SCMP, Wudang Mountain is one of the most sacred Taoist mountains in China. It is renowned for Tai Chi, which was created by the Taoism sage Zhang Sanfeng, who lived on it.\n\nTalking about his journey, Mr Pinnick said that initially he aimed to learn martial arts and enhance his health. However, as he followed his teacher to study Taoism texts, he found that martial arts can \"magically\" relieve pressure on a person, cultivate moral character and promote self-improvement.\n\nToday, Mr Pinnick has become a master on Wudang Mountain himself, teaching both Chinese and foreign students martial arts and Taoism. \"My advantage is probably the 'onlooker's perspective'. Due to the cultural difference, I must figure out the logic and details behind each movement and each Taoism theory. I think I have the responsibility to spread Chinese culture to more people and I am willing to take the role of telling China stories to the world,\" he explained.\n\nAlso Read | \"$300,000 Salary, Fit, Disciplined\": Woman's List Of Requirements For Future Husband Sparks Debate\n\nMr Pinnick said he has been given a Chinese name, Li Zigen, by his master on the mountain. He stated that he carefully chose Li as his surname also because both the Taoism founder Lao Tzu and Hong Kong-American martial artist and actor Bruce Lee shared the family name.\n\n\"It is the best recognition for a foreigner who loves Chinese culture. So please do not call me a foreigner any more,\" Mr Pinnick jokingly wrote on social media.\n\nAccording to SCMP, the 34-year-old is now married to a Chinese woman, with whom he has a daughter. His story has gone viral on social media. When internet users noticed his hair was not as light as it was many years ago and had turned a little black, Mr Pinnick denied he had dyed it. \"My hair has darkened. My body has gradually been affected after practising martial arts and staying in China for many years,\" he said.",

But volumes fell sharply in 2024 to around 5,500.\n\nThe move is the latest ripple effect from an escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington.\n\nDespite pulling back on many other tariffs, President Donald Trump has stuck firm to US duties on Chinese goods and raised them to 145 percent. In turn, China has increased tariffs on US exports, including cars, to 125 percent.\n\nOverall, Ford sold 442,000 vehicles -- made in the United States and elsewhere -- in China in 2024, comprising 1.6 percent of the market, according to the carmaker's latest annual report.\n\nThe US company operates a number of manufacturing joint ventures in China with Chinese companies, producing vehicles under both the Ford and Lincoln brands.\n\nSome of Ford's production in China is exported to other markets. One of these vehicles, the Lincoln Nautilus, is now subject to hefty US tariffs, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nFord's Chinese ventures resulted in 2024 operating profits of around $900 million, Ford Vice Chairman John Lawler said this week at a financial conference.",

    "content": "David Walt received a presidential medal in January for inventions that have enabled genetic screening for in vitro fertilization, better disease diagnosis and improved crop resistance. His latest work involved early detection of Lou Gehrig's disease, or ALS, with the goal of developing new drugs to manage the debilitating loss of muscle control from that condition.\n\nBut on Tuesday morning, Walt got an unwelcome update: The Department of Health and Human Services was ordering work to stop on his $650,000 government contract, part of an effort to force Harvard University to comply with the Trump administration's demands.\n\nUnless he can find alternative funds, his ALS research will end, Walt said.\n\n\"Patients will suffer unnecessarily and some will die unnecessarily,\" Walt, a professor of biologically inspired engineering at Harvard Medical school, wrote in an email.\n\nWalt's project is one of many that's getting caught in the middle of what's poised to become a protracted political and legal fight over the government's ability to dictate conditions to the nation's private universities, which receive billions in federal funding through grants and contracts. The White House continued to escalate its battle with Harvard on Friday as the Education Department claimed Harvard had made inaccurate and incomplete disclosures regarding funding from foreign sources.\n\nThe Trump administration says that it's seeking to protect Jewish students on college campuses. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, said the university is willing to work with the government but its demands won't address \"antisemitism in a cooperative and constructive manner.\" Instead, Harvard said the White House was seeking control over who the university hires, which students it admits and how it manages ideological diversity. The school has vowed that it won't \"surrender its independence or its constitutional rights.\"\n\nThe government has halted more than $2.2 billion in contracts and grants to Harvard in response. The Education Department has said funding for hospitals affiliated with the university isn't affected. But that still leaves plenty of scientific work at risk.\n\nThe federal government had pledged $2.5 billion for more than a thousand research projects at Harvard before the funding freeze. Nearly half of those were already in process, with the vast majority of the money coming through the National Institutes of Health. Those resources support studies on infectious diseases, pediatric health and the impact of aging.\n\nMedical Research is Hardest Hit | Among the HHS grants to Harvard, allergy and infectious disease studies are the largest recipients of federal funds\n\nHarvard researchers are finding out one-by-one whether their projects are affected.\n\nWalt's colleague, Donald Ingber, the founding director of Harvard's Wyss Institute, also received stop-work orders for two contracts. They total about $20 million and are related to research for human organ chips - devices designed to mimic real organs that could help replace animal testing in drug development and support studies on reducing the side effects of radiation.\n\n\"We will never get to Mars without developing ways to overcome the lethal effects of high energy radiation that an astronaut would experience during that long flight,\" said Ingber. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have called for ambitious plans to send humans to Mars. Ingber is seeking other funds to continue the work and keep on the roughly 20 researchers who assist him.\n\nThe Wyss Institute is funded by Harvard Business School alumnus Hansjorg Wyss, a Swiss billionaire.\n\nStill, it's unlikely that there's enough money from other sources to supplant the government's role in supporting scientific research.\n\nHarvard's School of Public Health also received stop-work orders for at least three contracts and grants: one for $60 million for tuberculosis research and smaller ones for research on breast cancer tumor sequencing and a study about the relationship between coffee intake and cancer.\n\nThe school faces a significant budget crisis because of the combined effects of the federal funding freeze and threats to international student enrollment, said Stephanie Simon, a spokesperson. Federal funding makes up 46% of the public health school's budget.\n\n\"We anticipate many more stop work orders coming,\" Simon said.\n\nWalt, the ALS researcher, has temporarily moved some staff to other projects that haven't been affected by the Trump administration's funding freeze. It's just a stop-gap measure, though, he said, and not sustainable unless the money starts flowing again.\n\nThe funding pause will \"jeopardize the scientific workforce and will cause huge damage to the economy,\" Walt said.",

Hamilton Police is investigating the homicide that happened Wednesday, saying Ms Randhawa was an innocent bystander.\n\nThe Consulate General of India in Toronto said in a post on X Friday, \"We are deeply saddened by the tragic death of Indian student Harsimrat Randhawa in Hamilton, Ontario.\"\n\n\"As per local police, she was an innocent victim, fatally struck by a stray bullet during a shooting incident involving two vehicles. A homicide investigation is currently underway. We are in close contact with her family and are extending all necessary assistance. Our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved family during this difficult time,\" the official added.\n\nHamilton Police in a statement said that at around 7.30 pm local time, it received reports of a shooting near Upper James and South Bend Road streets in Hamilton. When police arrived, they found Randhawa with a gunshot wound to the chest. She was rushed to a hospital, but succumbed.\n\nThrough collected video, investigators have determined that a passenger of a black car fired at the occupants of a white sedan. Shortly after the shooting, the vehicles left the scene.\n\nShots from the shooting incident also entered the rear window of a residence nearby where the occupants were watching television a few feet away. No one was injured in the home, police said.\n\nInvestigators are asking anyone with dashcam or security camera footage between 7.15 pm and 7.45 pm near the shooting area to contact authorities and provide any information that can help further the investigation.",

    "content": "Kinshasa, DR Congo:\n\nAt least 143 people died and dozens more went missing after a boat carrying fuel caught fire and capsized in the Democratic Republic of Congo, officials said Friday.\n\nHundreds of passengers were crowded onto a wooden boat on the Congo River in northwest DRC on Tuesday when the blaze broke out, according to Josephine-Pacifique Lokumu, head of a delegation of national deputies from the region.\n\nThe disaster occurred near Mbandaka, capital of Equateur Province, at the confluence of the Ruki and the vast Congo river -- the world's deepest.\n\n\"A first group of 131 bodies were found on Wednesday, with a further 12 fished out on Thursday and Friday. Several of them are charred,\" Lokumu told AFP.\n\nJoseph Lokondo, a local civil society leader who said he helped bury the bodies, put the \"provisional death count at 145: some burned, others drowned\".\n\nLokumu said the blaze was caused by a fuel explosion ignited by an onboard cooking fire.\n\n\"A woman lit the embers for cooking. The fuel, which was not far away, exploded, killing many children and women\", she said.\n\nVideos circulating on social media showed flames leaping from a long boat stranded far from shore, with smoke billowing from the wreckage and people aboard smaller vessels looking on.\n\nMissing loved ones\n\nThe total number of passengers on board the doomed vessel was not known but Lokumu said it was in the \"hundreds\".\n\nSome survivors were rescued and admitted to hospital, Lokondo said.\n\nBut on Friday, he added, \"several families were still without news of their loved ones\".\n\nA vast Central African nation that covers 2.3 million square kilometres (900,000 square miles), the DRC suffers from a lack of practicable roads and planes serve only a limited number of cities and towns.\n\nAs a result people often travel on lakes, the Congo River -- the second longest in Africa after the Nile -- and its winding tributaries, where shipwrecks are frequent and the death counts often heavy.\n\nA chronic absence of passenger lists often complicates search operations.\n\nIn October 2023, at least 47 people died after a boat navigating the Congo sank in Equateur.\n\nMore than 20 people died in October last year when a boat capsized on Lake Kivu in eastern DRC, according to local authorities.\n\nAnother shipwreck on Lake Kivu claimed around 100 lives in 2019.",

    "content": "Stargazers across the globe are in for a treat as a rare triple planetary conjunction is set to light up the skies with a \"smiley face\" on April 25, Friday. According to LiveScience, this rare conjunction will be visible for a short period, but it can be viewed from anywhere around the world. The arrangement of Venus, Saturn and the crescent moon will create this unique visual phenomenon resembling a smiling face in the sky. While the two planets will act as the \"eyes\" of the \"smile\", the delicate crescent Moon will form the \"mouth\".\n\nNotably, a triple conjunction occurs when three celestial bodies line up in the sky, appearing close to each other. On the morning of April 25, Venus, Saturn and the crescent moon will appear close together in the predawn sky, forming a triangular formation reminiscent of a smiley face. This alignment will be visible to anyone who has a clear view of the eastern horizon before sunrise on Friday, April 25, LiveScience reported.\n\nWhat is a triple conjunction?\n\nA conjunction occurs when two or more celestial objects appear very close to each other in the night sky. When three celestial objects are involved, it becomes a triple conjunction.\n\n\"Venus is higher above the eastern horizon with Saturn lower, and a thin, crescent Moon a bit lower and a little farther north. The thin, crescent Moon looks like a smile. To some people, the triangle of bright objects may appear as a smiley face,\" said NASA Solar System Ambassador Brenda Culbertson.\n\nWhen will the triple \"smiley\" conjunction be visible?\n\nThe face will be visible from anywhere in the world with good viewing conditions.\n\nTo catch the best view, make sure you're looking towards the eastern horizon on the morning of April 25. The triple conjunctions will \"smile\" early in the morning, just one hour before sunrise. \"Anyone wanting to try for a glimpse of the conjunction should find a clear eastern horizon from which to observe,\" Mr Culbertson said.\n\nNotably, this rare event happens right after the Lyrid meteor shower reaches its peak, so the night sky will already be bustling with activity.\n\nHow to view the triple 'smiley' conjunction?\n\nVenus and Saturn will shine brightly, easily visible with the naked eye, but a good backyard telescope or stargazing binoculars can help you pick out details on the smirking crescent moon.\n\nFor those with a clear horizon, Mercury may also be visible below the twinkling trio.",

    "content": "New Delhi:\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Friday evening shared a photograph that he claimed showed the tattooed knuckles of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man who was deported to El Salvador last month amid controversy.\n\nThe image, posted to Trump's social media accounts, purported to be \"proof\" that Abrego Garcia is a member of the violent MS-13 gang. But the photo is now under scrutiny, with critics - including tech experts and political opponents - suggesting it was digitally manipulated.\n\nAbrego Garcia, 29, was deported, but his legal team argues that it was against US law.\n\nTrump's post, featuring a black-and-white photo of a man's knuckles with the letters \"MS-13\" above four small symbols, was accompanied by a caption attacking Democrats for allegedly defending \"a fine and innocent person\" who Trump insists is a violent gang member.\n\n\"This is the hand of the man that the Democrats feel should be brought back to the United States, because he is such \"a fine and innocent person.\" They said he is not a member of MS-13, even though he's got MS-13 tattooed onto his knuckles, and two Highly Respected Courts found that he was a member of MS-13, beat up his wife, etc. I was elected to take bad people out of the United States, among other things. I must be allowed to do my job. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" Trump's post read.\n\nAlmost immediately, the image began drawing accusations of digital doctoring. Several users on social media platforms noted discrepancies in lighting and typography on the tattoo. \"'MS-13' looks like it was typed on the photo,\" one user wrote, while others pointed to the pixelated appearance and alignment of the letters as evidence of tampering.\n\nLinda Higgins, a former Minnesota state senator, responded on X (formerly Twitter): \"Hey Old Man, @realDonaldTrump, have someone teach you about Photoshop. This is an excellent example of altering a photo, in this case to make your illegal actions look good.\"\n\nThough Trump has insisted the image confirms Abrego Garcia's gang membership, court documents filed by US government attorneys have never mentioned tattoos as part of their case.\n\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi this week released documents claiming that Abrego Garcia was known by the gang rank \"Chequeo\" and street name \"Chele,\" but the filings did not include any photographic or physical evidence to establish gang membership.\n\nSeveral social media sleuths pointed to older images of Abrego Garcia, including videos posted by his wife on TikTok, that show tattoos on his knuckles but not the text \"MS-13.\"\n\nAbrego Garcia arrived in the US as a 16-year-old in 2011, fleeing threats from Barrio 18 gang members who extorted his family's small food shop in El Salvador. His family had feared he would be recruited by criminal groups. He began working in construction in Maryland and later became the main provider for his family of five, including two children with autism.\n\nIn 2019, he was detained outside a Home Depot by an anti-gang unit. A confidential informant claimed he was affiliated with MS-13. Yet, an immigration judge later ruled that deporting him would put him at risk, allowing him to remain in the US with a work permit.\n\nThat protection was upended this March, when he was detained while shopping with his son and swiftly deported to El Salvador within three days, despite the standing court order.",

One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile.\n\nSome firms tested their robots for weeks before the race.

This is the first time they have raced alongside humans.\n\nChina is hoping that investment in frontier industries like robotics can help create new engines of economic growth. Some analysts, though, question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential.\n\nAlan Fern, professor of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics at Oregon State University, said contrary to claims from Beijing officials that such a race requires \"AI breakthroughs\", the software enabling humanoid robots to run was developed and demonstrated more than five years ago.\n\n\"(The robot half-marathon) is more of a hardware endurance demonstration,\" he said.\n\n\"Chinese companies have really focused on showing off walking, running, dancing, and other feats of agility. Generally, these are interesting demonstrations, but they don't demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence,\" Fern said.",

The collections include early photographs, correspondence and notebooks, the UNESCO said.\n\nThis nomination was sent by the United Kingdom.\n\nSome of the landmark treaties marking major milestones of multilateralism have also been included in the register.\n\nSeveral collections document key moments in international cooperation, including the Geneva Conventions (1864-1949) and their protocols (1977-2005), the UDHR and the 1991 Windhoek Declaration, a global reference for press freedom, the UNESCO said in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"The Geneva Conventions (1864, 1906, 1929, 1949) and their Additional Protocols (1977, 2005) are international treaties that contain the main rules aimed at limiting the brutality of war.

A release from the Madhya Pradesh government said this information was given by officials of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), who took part in a review meeting of the cheetah project in Bhopal on Friday in the presence of Union Minister for Environment, Forests and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav and MP Chief Minister Mohan Yadav.\n\n\"Efforts are underway to bring more cheetahs from South Africa, Botswana, and Kenya to India. Eight cheetahs will be brought to India in two phases. There is a plan to bring four cheetahs from Botswana to India by May. After this, four more cheetahs will be brought. At present, consent is being developed on an agreement between India and Kenya,\" the release quoted NTCA officials as saying.\n\nIn the meeting, NTCA officials informed that more than Rs 112 crore has been spent on the cheetah project in the country so far, of which 67 per cent has gone into cheetah rehabilitation in Madhya Pradesh, the release stated.\n\n\"Under Project Cheetah, cheetahs will now be relocated in a phased manner in Gandhi Sagar Sanctuary.

Amid the row over the 'Phule' movie, his reply to an X user that he would \"urinate on Brahmins\" sparked massive outrage and police complaints. His family has been getting rape and death threats for his remark, he has claimed in an apology note.\n\nNo action is worth the threat the family has been getting, said Mr Kashyap in his long note, which had more jibes than apologies.\n\n\"This is my apology, not for my post but for that one line taken out of context and the brewing hatred. No action or speech is worth your daughter, family, friends, and colleagues getting rape and death threats from the kingpins of sanskar,\" he said in his statement.\n\nRead: Anurag Kashyap Slams CBFC, Brahmin Community Over Phule Controversy\n\nMr Kashyap, known for movies like the two-part Gangs of Wasseypur, said his critics can abuse him all they want, but must spare his family.\n\n\"I won't take back what I said. Abuse me all you want. My family didn't say anything. If you want an apology, here it is. Brahmins, spare the women. These values are imbibed in our scriptures, too, except for Manuwaad. Decide which Brahmin you are. Rest, here's an apology from me,\" he added.\n\nThe outrage follows Mr Kashyap's reply to a social media user who said, \"Brahmins are your fathers. The more you mess with them, the more they will burn you.\" \"I would urinate on Brahmins, any problem?\" he had replied. He also shared a screenshot of this exchange on Instagram.\n\nThe comment drew massive criticism with Union Minister Satish Chandra Dubey calling the filmmaker a \"vile scumbag\" and vowing not to stay silent until he apologises publicly.\n\n\"This vile scumbag (Anurag Kashyap) thinks he can spit filth on the entire Brahmin community and get away with it? If he doesn't issue a public apology immediately, I swear I'll make sure he finds no peace anywhere. Enough of this gutter mouth's hate, we won't stay silent,\" said the junior minister in the Coal Ministry.\n\nRead: Anurag Kashyap Says He's \"Busier Than Shah Rukh Khan\" After Leaving Mumbai\n\nA police complaint has also been filed in Mumbai by an advocate at the Bombay High Court.\n\nThe outrage over Mr Kashyap's comment comes amid a controversy over the 'Phule' movie, starring Pratik Gandhi and Patralekha. It is based on the lives of celebrated social reformers Jyotirao Phule and Savitribai Phule, who fought against caste discrimination and gender inequality in the 19th century.\n\nThe movie faced some censor board cuts after Brahmin groups objected to the movie's content and claimed it promotes casteism. The movie's release was postponed by two weeks to ensure it does not land in any other trouble. It will hit the theatres on April 25.",

After his police remand ended, the police presented Narendra Yadav before the court in Madhya Pradesh's Damoh and was ordered to remain in judicial custody until May 1.\n\nYadav is at the centre of a legal and medical controversy.\n\nAccused of performing cardiac surgeries on multiple patients, seven of whom tragically passed away under suspicious circumstances, he was under police remand since last one month.\n\nSpeaking to IANS, his lawyer, Sachin Nayak, said Yadav will apply for bail in the Sessions court on Monday as police questioning has concluded now.\n\nAccording to Nayak, the doctor experienced high blood pressure on Thursday night and was temporarily admitted to the Damoh district hospital for treatment before being returned to custody.\n\nPolice sources indicated that Yadav had not disclosed any medical conditions or medications, apart from blood pressure issues.\n\nA viral video capturing his hospital admission added further attention to the case.\n\nYadav's counsel had requested access to his mobile phone and for court appearances via video-conferencing.\n\nHowever, the public prosecutor opposed the requests, arguing that the phone was undergoing forensic analysis as part of the investigation, and only the court could decide on the mode of his appearance according to the jail manual.\n\nYadav later claimed to the media that he was innocent, asserting that his qualifications complied with all regulations, and mentioning his family is currently in abroad.\n\nHe also expressed full faith in the judicial system.\n\nThe scandal has escalated with significant repercussions.\n\nThe Chief Medical and Health Officer (CMHO) of Damoh, Mukesh Jain, suspended the license of Mission Hospital and sealed its Cath Lab where Yadav worked.\n\nThe police registered cases against him, following the CMHO's midnight complaint on April 6, which alleged that Yadav lacked the necessary qualifications for the surgeries he performed.\n\nLast Wednesday, a team of doctors and government officials revoked the hospital's license and sealed its remaining facilities.\n\nYadav, suspected of conducting 15 surgeries, seven of which resulted in deaths under questionable circumstances, remains under investigation.\n\nAllegations of impersonation have further fuelled the controversy, with reports claiming he adopted the pseudonym, N.

    "content": "New Delhi:\n\nDelhi's Tis Hazari Court has awarded life sentence to a 45-year-old man for raping and impregnating a 16-year-old girl. The court delivered the verdict within 20 days of hearing the case.\n\nAn FIR was filed at Police Station Nihal Vihar in February 2025. This case was instituted on March 28, 2025. The judgment was passed on April 15, and the court sentenced the convict the very next day.\n\nThe incident came to light on February 25, 2025, when the victim was admitted to the hospital with a complaint of abdominal pain. Upon examination, she was found to be in labour and subsequently gave birth to a baby.\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Babita Puniya awarded a life sentence to the convict under the POCSO Act.\n\n\"For the offence punishable under Section 6 of POCSO, he is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life, and to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000,\" ASJ Puniya said in the order dated April 16.\n\nDuring sentencing, the court took into account the ages of both the convict and the victim.\n\nThe court said, \"The convict was 45 years old while the victim was just 16 years old when she gave birth to a child, which means that the convict was 29/30 years older than the victim when he started sexually assaulting her. The comparative age of the victim and the accused is certainly an aggravating factor.\"\n\nThe court further noted, \"The convict had preyed upon an innocent and vulnerable girl child to quench his lust. He repeatedly made the victim the object of his lust and made her pregnant. She had to go through labour pains at the age of innocence.\n\n\"I have no doubt in my mind that this must have been an excruciating pain that the victim/child had endured,\" the judge said.\n\nThe court awarded the victim compensation of Rs 19.5 lakh.\n\nWhile granting compensation, the court said, \"She must have suffered and may still be suffering mental pain and agony because of the conduct of the convict. Though the suffering of the victim cannot be compensated in monetary terms, yet it would facilitate her to equip herself with desirable skills or education, which would in turn help her to achieve some level of independence.\"\n\n\"Thus, she shall also be entitled to Rs 2,00,000 under the head of mental injury and Rs 4,00,000 under the head of pregnancy,\" the court ordered.\n\nThe convict was known to her father.

    "content": "Alicia Davis, a 32-year-old Australian woman who is also an OnlyFans model, recently revealed that she ditched her prison guard duties to start an account on the adult platform. According to the New York Post, the former prison officer from Australia's Gold Coast said she was making $61,000 when she quit her job, where inmates would bombard her with compliments and sometimes even attempted to give her gifts. She revealed that despite prison policies banning makeup, jewellery, and personal expression, she couldn't escape the constant attention from inmates.\n\n\"I had to constantly reject them. They'd comment on my appearance, saying: 'You look really good today,' or noticing the finer details about my look,\" Ms Davis said, per the Post. \"It was sweet of them,\" she continued, admitting she enjoyed the compliments and attention. \"But it was so important for me to tell them that these sorts of comments aren't appropriate.\"\n\nThe 32-year-old said that she was harshly judged by prisoners' partners as well. \"Some of the wives used to come in and just stare me down. I don't know what their husbands said to them about me, but I didn't react to the comments or stares,\" she said.\n\nHer allure didn't go unnoticed outside the prison wall either, as Ms Davis shared that some inmates, once released, would track down her Instagram account and try to connect. \"They thought maybe something could happen,\" she said, firmly adding that she never reciprocated those advances.\n\nAlso Read | Australian CEO Faces Backlash For Bragging About First-Class Flight, He Reacts\n\nMs Davis further went on to say that her job demanded more than physical presence. It was emotionally draining as well, she said. Balancing professionalism amid constant flirtation, along with strict rules, was what wore her down. \"The prison job tied me down. I wasn't allowed to be myself - no makeup, no nails, no personality in my wardrobe. It was exhausting,\" she said.\n\nIt was in February 2022 that the 32-year-old finally decided to quit her job and launch her career on OnlyFans. She used to earn around $61,000 annually, but now her income is over $371,000 per year. \"My new career gives me the freedom to work in my own time and be myself with no restrictions,\" said Ms Davis. \"I can wear what I want and flirt with whoever I want without the fear of being punished,\" she added.",

    "content": "Washington:\n\nAbout 10,000 pages of records related to the 1968 assassination of Sen Robert F Kennedy were released Friday, including handwritten notes by the gunman, who said the Democratic presidential candidate \"must be disposed of\" and acknowledged an obsession with killing him.\n\nMany of the files had been made public previously, while others had not been digitized and sat for decades in federal government storage facilities. Their release continued the disclosure of historical investigation documents ordered by President Donald Trump.\n\nKennedy was fatally shot on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles moments after giving a speech celebrating his victory in California's presidential primary. His assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, was convicted of first-degree murder and is serving life in prison.\n\nThe files included pictures of handwritten notes by Sirhan.\n\n\"RFK must be disposed of like his brother was,\" read the writing on the outside of an empty envelope, referring to Kennedy's older brother, President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963. The return address was from the district director of the Internal Revenue Service in Los Angeles.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration posted 229 files containing the pages to its public website.\n\nThe release comes a month after unredacted files related to the assassination of President Kennedy were disclosed. Those documents gave curious readers more details about Cold War-era covert US operations in other nations but did not initially lend credence to long-circulating conspiracy theories about who killed JFK.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, the son of Robert Kennedy, commended the release.\n\n\"Lifting the veil on the RFK papers is a necessary step toward restoring trust in American government,\" the health secretary said in a statement.\n\nDocuments include interviews with assassin's acquaintances\n\nThe files surrounding Robert Kennedy's assassination also included notes from interviews with people who knew Sirhan from a wide variety of contexts, such as classmates, neighbors and coworkers. While some described him as \"a friendly, kind and generous person\" others depicted a brooding and \"impressionable\" young man who felt strongly about his political convictions and briefly believed in mysticism.\n\nAccording to the files, Sirhan told his garbage collector that he planned to kill Kennedy shortly after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968. The sanitation worker, a Black man, said he planned to vote for Kennedy because he would help Black people.\n\n\"Well, I don't agree. I am planning on shooting the son of a bitch,\" Sirhan replied, the man told investigators.\n\nLarry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of \"The Kennedy Half-Century,\" said there have always been conspiracies surrounding Robert Kennedy's assassination. He believes the rollout of documents Friday would be similar to the JFK documents released earlier this year.\n\nHe cautioned that a review needs to be done carefully and slowly, \"just in case there is a hint in there or there is an anecdote\" that could shed more light on the assassination.\n\n\"I hope there's more information,\" Sabato said. \"I'm doubtful that there is, just as I said when the JFK documents were released.\"\n\nSome redactions remained in the documents posted online Friday, including names and dates of birth. Last month, the Trump administration came under criticism over unredacted personal information, including Social Security numbers, during the release of records surrounding President John F. Kennedy's assassination.\n\nTrump, a Republican, has championed in the name of transparency the release of documents related to high-profile assassinations and investigations. But he has also been deeply suspicious for years of the government's intelligence agencies. His administration's release of once-hidden files opens the door for more public scrutiny of the operations and conclusions of institutions such as the CIA and the FBI.\n\nTrump signed an executive order in January calling for the release of government documents related to the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and King, who were killed within two months of each other.\n\nLawyers for Kennedy's killer have said for decades that he is unlikely to reoffend or pose a danger to society, and in 2021, a parole board deemed Sirhan suitable for release. But Gov. Gavin Newsom rejected the decision in 2022, keeping him in state prison. In 2023, a different panel denied him release, saying he still lacks insight into what caused him to shoot Kennedy.\n\nRFK still stands as a hero to American liberals\n\nKennedy remains an icon for liberals, who see him as a champion for human rights who also was committed to fighting poverty and racial and economic injustice. They often regard his assassination as the last in a series of major tragedies that put the US and its politics on a darker, more conservative path.\n\nHe was a sometimes divisive figure during his lifetime. Some critics thought he came late to opposing the Vietnam War, and he launched his campaign for president in 1968 only after the Democratic primary in New Hampshire exposed President Johnson's political weakness.\n\nKennedy's older brother appointed him US attorney general, and he remained a close aide to him until JFK's assassination in Dallas. In 1964, he won a US Senate seat from New York and was seen as the heir to the family's political legacy.",

Taking to Threads, Jake Bass shared a couple of photos showing the luxurious first-class experience, including his father relaxing in a private pod, enjoying fine dining and sipping drinks. \"Just flew my dad with me to Dubai. First class. Emirates. $50,000 flight. (A world away from the $1,200 I used to pay in economy.) 470 passengers. Only 2 in First Class-us,\" he wrote in the caption of the post.\n\n\"I sat there thinking-what made our journey so different from the 468 behind us? Then I saw the pilot adjust our course by just 1 degree to avoid turbulence. Barely noticeable... But hours later, we were far off the original path. That's when it clicked: Just a slight change in direction ... changes everything,\" Mr Bass added.\n\nThe 20-something's post quickly went viral online, with hundreds of people flooding his comments section with enraged responses. It was the tone of the post, coupled with its moral lesson, that irked netizens.\n\n\"The difference between you and the 468 behind you is that they didn't waste $50,000 on something as temporary as a seat on a plane,\" wrote one user. \"Funny, because without my glasses, I read your name as Jack A-. I'll leave it at that,\" commented another.\n\n\"Nobody buying your course lil bro,\" said a third user. \"You sound insufferable,\" one person commented.\n\nSome users also accused Mr Bass of sharing inaccurate prices and misleading photos of his first-class experience.\n\nHowever, reacting to the backlash, Mr Bass told the New York Post that he used ChatGPT to craft his post for maximum engagement. \"I say what I believe, and I get ChatGPT to work in a controversial way,\" he said. \"It's the algorithm that makes me sound like a douche,\" he continued.\n\nMr Bass underlined that he strongly agrees with the sentiment. \"To be completely honest, I don't think what I said was wrong at all. I shared a perspective - one that challenges people to reflect on their own choices, and that makes a lot of people uncomfortable. That's really what this is about: most people don't want to be reminded that they've settled,\" he said.\n\nAlso Read | Travel Vlogger Highlights Challenges Of Travelling With Indian Passport, Sparks Debate\n\nIn response to the online outrage, Mr Bass also offered to fly one of the followers anywhere in the world, provided they followed him on both X and Instagram.\n\nAs his original tweet went viral, he also stated that it was proof he was \"doing something right\". However, he rejected being deemed \"entitled\", saying that those who know him are aware that he isolated himself for five years, working hard and avoiding social media. \"This life was earned,\" he wrote on Instagram.\n\nHe then revealed to his audience that he had used ChatGPT to write the tweet, to intentionally \"trigger emotion, create division, and spark mass engagement.\"\n\nA few days later, he also appeared to have attempted the same formula, posting a similar tweet, claiming to have another inspiring epiphany while watching people board economy.\n\nThe second post was also met with criticism. \"Your post comes off as super smug schmuck, implying that those who can't afford to fly first class are just victims of their own poor life choices.

    "content": "Indian scientists, in collaboration with global experts from NASA and the European Space Agency, have pitched to do seven specific experiments on board the International Space Station (ISS) when 'Gaganyatri' or an astronaut flies to the space laboratory as part of the Axiom-4 mission - scheduled no earlier than May this year. Axiom-4 is a private commercial space flight where India is paying between $60-70 million for the mission.\n\nEarlier, whenever India has collaborated with global space agencies, there have been startling findings. The best example is India's maiden outing to the moon through Chandrayaan-1 in 2008. During this mission, the finding that the moon's surface is not parched and has the presence of water molecules came through an instrument made by NASA and flown free of cost to the moon by India. The NASA-ISRO collaboration rewrote the history of lunar geology and opened doors for possible permanent human habitation on the moon.\n\nIndia has limited experience in doing biology in space.\n\nOnly earlier this year on India's own mini space laboratory, the first ever biology experiments were flown including growing lobia seeds in space, growing spinach cells and bacteria. Hence, it seems ISRO has opted to get hand-held by global institutions that have done serious micro-gravity experiments in space.\n\nIncidentally, the ISS has now been continuously inhabited by humans for the last 25 years, with the 21st century witnessing the space laboratory as humanity's outpost in space. The flying outpost, which sees 16 sunsets and sunrises every day has been home to some very rigorous scientific experiments. India was never a part of ISS and hence this will be the first time an Indian may reach the ISS.\n\nThe private space company Axiom Space, in a statement, said, \"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is spearheading transformative research on Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4), in collaboration with NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). Scientifically, the studies will contribute to understanding biological processes in microgravity, leading to developments in life sciences.\"\n\nIt added, \"Technologically, developing resources for long-duration space missions will enhance India's capabilities in space exploration, positioning the country as a leader in cutting-edge space technology. The studies also play a crucial role in inspiring the next generation of Indian scientists and engineers, while reinforcing India's commitment to global scientific progress and its influential presence in the international space community.\"\n\nHere are the experiments that will be performed on the Axiom-4 space flight:\n\nHuman Research: Interaction With Electronic Displays In Microgravity\n\nOne Axiom-4 experiment focuses on how astronauts interact with electronic displays in microgravity. Partnering with NASA and Voyager, ISRO aims to understand the physical and cognitive impacts of using computer screens in space. This research will delve into how tasks like pointing, gaze fixation, and rapid eye movements are affected in microgravity, and how these changes might influence stress levels. The findings could inform the design and interaction of future spacecraft computers, making them more user-friendly for astronauts.\n\nLife Science: Microalgae And Cyanobacteria Studies\n\nISRO has a strong portfolio of life science experiments. In collaboration with NASA and Redwire, the \"Space Microalgae\" project investigates the impact of microgravity on the growth, metabolism, and genetic activity of three strains of edible microalgae. These tiny organisms could become a sustainable food source for long-duration space missions, thanks to their rich protein, lipid, and bioactive components.\n\nAnother project, in partnership with ESA, examines cyanobacteria, aquatic bacteria capable of photosynthesis. By comparing two strains of cyanobacteria, ISRO aims to understand their growth rates, cellular responses, and biochemical activity in microgravity. This research could pave the way for integrating these bacteria into spacecraft environmental control systems, enhancing life support for future missions.\n\nMuscle Regeneration And Crop Growth In Space\n\nThe \"Effect of Metabolic Supplement on Muscle Regeneration Under Microgravity\" project, conducted in collaboration with NASA and BioServe Space Technologies, seeks to uncover the pathways responsible for muscle dysfunction in space. By identifying molecular mechanisms and potential interventions, the research could help prevent muscle atrophy in astronauts during long missions. The findings might also have significant implications for treating muscle-related diseases on Earth.\n\nISRO is also exploring the potential of growing crops in space. The \"Sprouting Salad Seeds in Space\" experiment, in collaboration with NASA and BioServe Space Technologies, investigates the germination and growth of crop seeds in microgravity. By studying the effects on genetics, microbial load, and nutritional profile over multiple generations, this project aims to ensure are reliable food source for future space explorers.\n\nTardigrades: The Ultimate Survivors\n\nIn partnership with NASA and Voyager, ISRO is studying the resilience of tardigrades, tiny creatures known for their ability to survive extreme conditions. This experiment will examine the revival, survival, and reproduction of tardigrades on the International Space Station, comparing gene expression patterns between space-flown and ground control populations. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of their resilience could inform future space exploration and lead to innovative biotechnology applications on Earth.\n\nA Vision For The Future\n\nAccording to Axiom Space, ISRO's research on Axiom-4 is a testament to India's dedication to advancing space science and technology. These experiments not only promise significant scientific advancements but will also inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers, it said.\n\nAs India strengthens its presence in space, it continues to contribute to global scientific progress, paving the way for a future where humanity can thrive beyond our home planet.\n\nBeyond the Axiom-4 mission, India already has its plans to rocket an Indian to space from Sriharikota in the 2026-2027 time frame and then have its own 'Bharatiya Antariksha Station' or Indian Space Station by 2035. It also aims to land an Indian on the moon surface using 'swadeshi' or Indian technology by 2040.\n\nThe Axiom-4 mission is just one stepping stone in a long road that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has carved for India in space.",

    "content": "New Delhi:\n\nDelhi's Tis Hazari Court has awarded life sentence to a 45-year-old man for raping and impregnating a 16-year-old girl. The court delivered the verdict within 20 days of hearing the case.\n\nAn FIR was filed at Police Station Nihal Vihar in February 2025. This case was instituted on March 28, 2025. The judgment was passed on April 15, and the court sentenced the convict the very next day.\n\nThe incident came to light on February 25, 2025, when the victim was admitted to the hospital with a complaint of abdominal pain. Upon examination, she was found to be in labour and subsequently gave birth to a baby.\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Babita Puniya awarded a life sentence to the convict under the POCSO Act.\n\n\"For the offence punishable under Section 6 of POCSO, he is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life, and to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000,\" ASJ Puniya said in the order dated April 16.\n\nDuring sentencing, the court took into account the ages of both the convict and the victim.\n\nThe court said, \"The convict was 45 years old while the victim was just 16 years old when she gave birth to a child, which means that the convict was 29/30 years older than the victim when he started sexually assaulting her. The comparative age of the victim and the accused is certainly an aggravating factor.\"\n\nThe court further noted, \"The convict had preyed upon an innocent and vulnerable girl child to quench his lust. He repeatedly made the victim the object of his lust and made her pregnant. She had to go through labour pains at the age of innocence.\n\n\"I have no doubt in my mind that this must have been an excruciating pain that the victim/child had endured,\" the judge said.\n\nThe court awarded the victim compensation of Rs 19.5 lakh.\n\nWhile granting compensation, the court said, \"She must have suffered and may still be suffering mental pain and agony because of the conduct of the convict. Though the suffering of the victim cannot be compensated in monetary terms, yet it would facilitate her to equip herself with desirable skills or education, which would in turn help her to achieve some level of independence.\"\n\n\"Thus, she shall also be entitled to Rs 2,00,000 under the head of mental injury and Rs 4,00,000 under the head of pregnancy,\" the court ordered.\n\nThe Convict was known to her father.

    "content": "Washington:\n\nThe White House on Friday unveiled a revamped Covid-19 website that promoted the contentious theory that the virus leaked from a Chinese laboratory, framing it as the pandemic's \"true origins.\"\n\nThe Covid.gov website, previously focused on promoting vaccine and testing information, now includes a full-length image of President Donald Trump and criticizes the pandemic policies implemented under former president Joe Biden.\n\nThe site also targets Anthony Fauci, Biden's former chief medical advisor, for advancing what it calls the \"preferred narrative that Covid-19 originated naturally.\"\n\nIt presents five bullet points aimed at bolstering the lab leak theory, noting that Wuhan, the site of the first known coronavirus case, is also home to China's \"foremost SARS research lab\" and has a history of conducting research at \"inadequate biosafety levels.\"\n\n\"By nearly all measures of science, if there was evidence of a natural origin it would have already surfaced. But it hasn't,\" the website said.\n\nThe lab-leak theory, once dismissed as a conspiracy theory, has recently gained mainstream traction in the United States.\n\nEven as the debate remains unresolved -- scientifically and politically -- US agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Energy have come out in support of the theory, albeit with varying levels of confidence.\n\nEarlier this year, the Central Intelligence Agency shifted its official stance on the virus's origin, saying that it was \"more likely\" leaked from a Chinese lab than transmission from animals.\n\nThe assessment drew criticism from China, which said it was \"extremely unlikely\" Covid-19 came from a laboratory.\n\nBeijing also urged the United States to \"stop politicizing and instrumentalizing the issue of origin-tracing.\"\n\nThe United States and China are currently locked in a major trade war, with Washington announcing Thursday new port fees for Chinese-linked ships and increased tariffs for Chinese goods.\n\nThe revamped White House site, which apparently seeks to redefine the political narrative about Covid-19, also criticized the mask and social distancing mandates introduced at the start of the pandemic in 2020. There is also a map of Wuhan that is animated to throb.\n\nUnder a section titled \"Covid-19 misinformation,\" it also accused public health officials under the previous administration of demonizing \"alternative treatments\" and colluding with social media companies to censor dissenting views about the pandemic -- a charge frequently echoed by US conservatives.\n\nThe Biden administration has previously rejected the charge that it was suppressing or censoring conservative perspectives.\n\nThe website revamp comes after layoffs began earlier this month at major US health agencies, as the Trump administration embarks on a sweeping and scientifically contested restructuring that will cut 10,000 jobs.\n\nHealth secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr -- who has alarmed health experts with his rhetoric downplaying the importance of vaccines -- said the layoffs were part of a major reform of his department, aiming to refocus efforts on chronic disease prevention.\n\nMore than one million people died of Covid-19 and related illnesses in the United States, and millions more were lost around the world.",

In Hindi, 'char' means four and 'dham' refers to religious destinations.\n\nIt is believed that one should complete the Char Dham Yatra in a clockwise direction. Hence, the pilgrimage begins at Yamunotri, proceeds to Gangotri, then to Kedarnath, and finally concludes at Badrinath. The journey can be completed by road or by air, with helicopter services also available. Some devotees undertake a Do Dham Yatra, a pilgrimage to two shrines: Kedarnath and Badrinath.\n\nOn April 10, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami stated that the state government is dedicated to ensuring the safety of Char Dham Yatra pilgrims, as this pilgrimage is vital for the state's economy.\n\n\"The preparations for the Char Dham Yatra are underway.

US Central Command will remain poised to continue strikes against the remnants of (IS) in Syria,\" Parnell added, referring to the military command responsible for the region.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has long been skeptical of Washington's presence in Syria, ordering the withdrawal of troops during his first term but ultimately leaving American forces in the country.\n\nAs Islamist-led rebels pressed forward with a lightning offensive last December that ultimately overthrew Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Trump said Washington should \"NOT GET INVOLVED!\"\n\n\"Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,\" Trump, then the president-elect, wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\n- Years of war against IS -\n\nThe 2014 onslaught by IS prompted a US-led air campaign in support of local ground forces -- the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Iraqi government units.\n\nWashington also deployed thousands of American personnel to advise and assist local forces, with US troops in some cases directly fighting the jihadists.\n\nAfter years of bloody warfare, Iraq's prime minister announced a final victory over IS in December 2017, while the SDF proclaimed the defeat of the group's \"caliphate\" in March 2019 after seizing its final bastion in Syria.\n\nBut the jihadists still have some fighters in the countryside of both countries, and US forces have long carried out periodic strikes and raids to help prevent the group's resurgence.\n\nWashington stepped up military action against IS in Syria in the wake of Assad's overthrow, though it has more recently shifted its focus to strikes targeting Yemen's Huthi rebels, who have been attacking international shipping since late 2023.\n\nUS forces in Iraq and Syria were repeatedly targeted by pro-Iran militants following the outbreak of the Gaza war in October 2023, but responded with heavy strikes on Tehran-linked targets, and the attacks largely subsided.\n\nWashington for years said it had some 900 military personnel in Syria as part of international efforts against IS, but the Pentagon announced in December 2024 that the number of US troops in the country had doubled to around 2,000 earlier in the year.\n\nWhile the United States is reducing its forces in Syria, Iraq has also sought an end to the US-led coalition's presence there, where Washington has said it has some 2,500 troops.\n\nThe United States and Iraq have announced that the coalition would end its decade-long military mission in federal Iraq by the end of 2025, and by September 2026 in the autonomous Kurdistan region.",

Hence he/she is Constitutionally not permitted to vote during their 10-year term in office. The other person is allowed to vote, but chooses not to, as part of an age-old tradition while also preserving the political neutrality of their office. That person is the Governor-General of Canada, who holds the powers and responsibilities of King Charles - who is not just the monarch of the UK, but is also the monarch and head of state of Canada.\n\nThe number of constituencies in Canada has increased from 338 in 2021 to 343 in 2025 due to a rise in population. But what is interesting to note, is that there are three territories in Canada's northernmost region which have only one seat each - meaning there is only 1 senator from each territory. These three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut (since 1999), and Yukon.\n\nMost Canadians have been given a card in their mail, which indicate their polling booth, among other details. While this may be considered an ID to vote, a voter is not mandated to carry the voting card on the day of voting, though carrying it will make the process easier at the polling station.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Canada is not required to be a member of parliament. The current Prime Minister Mark Carney is an example of this. Mr Carney is a former banker from Canada's Central Bank. He is not a sitting MP, meaning he does not hold a seat in the House of Commons. The 2025 elections are the first time that Mr Carney is contesting an election. Other former Prime Ministers of Canada who did not have a seat in the House of Commons were Charles Tupper, Arthur Meighen, and John Turner.\n\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world",

    "link": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-could-quit-ukraine-talks-if-no-progress-warns-donald-trump-8199126#publisher=newsstand",
    "content": "Washington:\n\nUS President Donald Trump said Thursday that Washington could quit talks to end the Ukraine war within days unless there is rapid progress from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nThe warning confirmed a sudden change of US messaging, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier saying in Paris that the United States would \"move on\" if peace was not \"doable.\"\n\nTrump has been pressing both sides for a truce, but has failed to extract any major concessions from the Kremlin despite an ice-breaking call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and repeated negotiations with Moscow.\n\n\"Yeah very shortly,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked to confirm what Rubio had said about abandoning talks. \"No specific number of days, but quickly. We want to get it done.\"\n\nTrump refused to cast blame on either Putin, who ordered the February 2022 full-scale invasion of pro-Western Ukraine, or Kyiv's President Volodymyr Zelensky. But he insisted both sides had to make progress.\n\n\"Now if for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say: 'You're foolish. You're fools. You're horrible people' -- and we're going to just take a pass,\" Trump said.\n\n\"But hopefully we won't have to do that.\"\n\n- 'Move on' -\n\nMoscow has kept up strikes on Ukraine, killing at least two people and wounding dozens more in attacks on the northeastern regions of Kharkiv and Sumy, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nOne of the few commitments Trump had wrangled from Russia -- a temporary moratorium on striking Ukrainian energy infrastructure -- \"expired\" on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to an AFP question.\n\nAfter meeting European officials in Paris to discuss a ceasefire, Rubio said Washington needed to figure out soon whether a ceasefire was \"doable in the short term.\"\n\n\"Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on,\" he told reporters.\n\nBut speaking on a trip to Italy, US Vice President JD Vance still insisted he was \"optimistic\" about ending the three-year war.\n\nTrump promised to end the war within 24 hours of taking office but has little to show for his efforts so far.\n\nHe has embarked on a rapprochement quest with the Kremlin that has alarmed Kyiv and driven a wedge between the United States and its European allies.\n\nHe and Vance also had a blazing Oval Office row in February with Zelensky, whom he still accuses of bearing responsibility for Moscow's invasion.\n\nTrump insisted that he was not being \"played\" by Moscow, which is accused by Ukraine of dragging its feet.\n\n\"My whole life has been one big negotiation and I know when people are playing us and I know when they're not,\" the billionaire property tycoon added.\n\n- 'Mockery' -\n\nZelensky meanwhile slammed the latest attacks on his country, which came just days before Easter.\n\nKyiv earlier announced it had received the bodies of 909 soldiers from Russia.\n\n\"This is how Russia started Good Friday -- with ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, Shahed drones. A mockery of our people and cities,\" Zelensky said on Telegram.\n\nRussia said it had hit \"key drone production sites\" and Ukrainian military airfields.\n\nPutin last month rejected a joint US-Ukrainian proposal for a full and unconditional pause in the conflict, while the Kremlin has made a truce in the Black Sea conditional on the West lifting certain sanctions.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly expressed anger and frustration at Zelensky in a marked break from his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nUkraine is set to sign a deal next week in Washington that would give the United States sweeping access to its mineral resources.\n\nEuropean powers have meanwhile been seeking a seat at the table in the negotiations, particularly as Trump's administration insists the continent should share the burden for Ukraine's security.\n\nFrance hosted meetings between US and European officials in Paris on Thursday, saying the talks had launched a \"positive process.\"\n\nThe meetings included French President Emmanuel Macron, Rubio and US envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nMany allies have however been alarmed by Witkoff -- who recently met Putin in Russia -- repeating Moscow's talking points about the war.",

    "content": "Imphal/Guwahati/New Delhi:\n\nThe Manipur BJP has denied allegations by a Congress spokesperson and lawyer from the Meitei community of spreading rumours that he helped the Kuki tribes in pursuing a case, being heard in the Supreme Court, against former chief minister N Biren Singh.\n\nThe Congress spokesperson, N Bupenda Meitei, in a statement said he \"asked the BJP and its cohorts to stop spreading such rumour and fake news against me and my party, the Congress.\"\n\nA Manipur BJP spokesperson on Friday told reporters in the state capital Imphal the party is not aware of the matter that Mr Meitei referred to, and they have nothing to do with it.\n\nPosts on social media surfaced on Thursday alleging Mr Meitei helped a petitioner from the Kuki tribes in pursuing a case in the Supreme Court, which asked for an investigation to be launched against Biren Singh for allegedly admitting in a leaked audio tape - which the Kuki tribes obtained - that he was responsible for the outbreak of the Manipur ethnic clashes in May 2023.\n\nWith the valley-dominant Meitei community and the Kuki tribes who are dominant in some hill areas of Manipur sharply divided, the Congress spokesperson raised concerns over possible attacks on him and his property due to the \"rumours\" on social media. Mr Meitei lives with his family in the state capital Imphal.\n\n\"It's extremely unfortunate to see the spread of rumour and false news dragging my name in a case which is not related with me. Neither the petitioner nor the respondent in the alleged audio tape case in the Supreme Court has engaged me as their advocate. I have neither signed in their vakalatnama nor met any of the petitioner or the respondent in the case,\" Mr Meitei posted on X on Thursday.\n\nOn Friday, he told Governor AK Bhalla - Manipur is under the President's rule - that rumours and fake news can potentially lead to mob violence in an already turbulent state.\n\nHS Benjamin Mate, chairman of the Kuki Organisation for Human Rights Trust (KOHUR), the petitioner in the audio tape case, asked the Congress spokesperson to \"extend\" his \"benevolence\" at critics while he was still firefighting on social media due to the rumours.\n\n\"Pu Bupenda Meitei, please extend your benevolence and forgive them, for they are gripped by fear, anxiously thinking about the upcoming Supreme Court hearing on May 5th and its potential repercussions,\" Mr Mate said in a post on X, alluding to the Congress's repeated criticism of the BJP-led Centre and the state government over their handling of the Manipur crisis.\n\nIn the last hearing on Thursday, the Centre told the Supreme Court that the government forensic lab report on the audio tape was ready and will be submitted in a sealed cover soon. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre and the state, during the hearing told the Supreme Court that the petitioner had \"ideological inclinations\" and there was a report by a committee of three high court judges which said there were efforts to keep the \"pot boiling\" in Manipur.\n\nIn March 2019, Mr Mate's name was recommended by the Zomi Reunification Organisation (ZRO) and the Kuki National Organisation (KNO) to the then national BJP chief Amit Shah for a ticket to contest one of the two Lok Sabha seats in Manipur, the Outer (reserved) seat. The ZRO also wrote separately backing Mr Mate for the Outer Manipur seat in the Lok Sabha.\n\nThe ZRO is the parent body of the militant group Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA), and the KNO represents over a dozen Kuki militant groups.\n\nREAD | Manipur Militants Write To Amit Shah Backing BJP Lok Sabha Contender\n\nWhile militant groups helping political parties behind the scene have been part of electoral politics in the northeast, it was for the first time that big militant groups openly wrote about backing candidates from mainstream parties.\n\nThe valley-dominant Meitei community and over a dozen distinct tribes collectively known as Kuki, who are dominant in some hill areas of Manipur, have been fighting since May 2023 over a range of issues such as land rights and political representation. Over 260 have died in the violence and nearly 50,000 have been internally displaced.",

    "content": "Canada is gearing up for a pivotal election on April 28, with the Liberal Party, led by Mark Carney, and the Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, neck-and-neck in the polls. The outcome will determine the next prime minister, as the leader of the party that wins the most seats traditionally assumes the role. This election marks a significant shift, as it's the first time in a decade without former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the ballot.\n\nMark Carney: The Incumbent Prime Minister\n\nMark Carney, 60, is the incumbent prime minister, having taken over the role just a few weeks ago. He was chosen by his party with over 85% of the vote to succeed Trudeau as Liberal leader. Carney's background as the head of the Banks of Canada and England has earned him recognition for his financial expertise. Notably, he navigated the 2008 financial crash and Brexit. Born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, Carney is the first Canadian prime minister from the north. He has taken a firm stance against US President Donald Trump's tariffs, vowing retaliation and asserting that Canada will never become the 51st US state. However, Carney's lack of experience in public office in Canada and limited fluency in French may pose challenges.\n\nPierre Poilievre: The Conservative Challenger\n\nPierre Poilievre, 45, has been a prominent figure in Canadian politics for nearly two decades. He was first elected to the House of Commons at 25, making him one of the youngest MPs of the time and has consistently advocated for low taxes and small government. Poilievre has a confrontational style of politics and has attacked the Liberals and Trudeau, promising a return to \"common sense politics\" and resonating with Canadians concerned about the housing crisis, stagnant wages, and high living costs. He also said that the Liberals' “disastrous” and “woke” policies have worsened the quality of life in Canada. However, his populist approach has led to comparisons to Trump, which Poilievre has sought to distance himself from. Trump himself has said Poilievre is not \"MAGA enough,\" while tech titan Elon Musk has praised the Conservative leader.\n\nYves-François Blanchet: The Bloc Québécois Leader\n\nYves-François Blanchet, 60, leads the Bloc Québécois, a Quebec sovereignist party that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province. While unlikely to become prime minister, the party's popularity in Quebec can significantly impact the election outcome. Blanchet has been frank in his criticism of Trump's rhetoric, calling the 25% US tariffs on Canadian aluminum rhetoric nonsense. He has pushed for Quebec to diversify its trade partners and secure a prominent seat in Canada's economic planning. With the US tariffs affecting Quebec's aluminum industry, Blanchet's message may resonate with voters.\n\nJagmeet Singh: The New Democratic Party Leader\n\nJagmeet Singh, 46, is the leader of the New Democratic Party (NDP), a left-leaning party focused on worker and labour issues. He made history as the first ethnic minority and practicing Sikh to lead a major Canadian party. The NDP had supported the Trudeau government, but Singh tore up the \"supply and confidence\" agreement, citing the Liberals' handling of a railway work stoppage. With polls indicating only 8.5% of Canadians intend to vote for the NDP, as of mid-April, the party faces a challenge in retaining seats and maintaining official party status.\n\nKey Poll Numbers:",

    "title": "Was Harvard vs Trump clash triggered by an ‘unauthorised’ letter?",
    "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/world/harvard-vs-trump-clash-unauthorised-letter-9953451/",
    "content": "Believing it had no other choice, Harvard publicly announced on April 14 that it would push back against the Trump administration’s directives. But shortly after that statement, a top administration official contacted Harvard and claimed the letter was sent in error. The official described the communication as “unauthorised,” according to sources cited by The New York Times.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe letter was reportedly sent by Sean Keveney, acting general counsel at the Department of Health and Human Services and a member of the antisemitism task force. While the document’s contents were reportedly genuine, confusion surrounded whether it was intended to be shared with Harvard at that stage—or at all.\n\nThree individuals briefed on the situation said some White House officials believed the letter was meant only for internal circulation, while others thought it had been released prematurely. All sources requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of internal deliberations.\n\nThe timing further complicated the episode. Harvard had been in what it viewed as productive dialogue with the task force over the prior two weeks and had hoped to avoid a public confrontation with the President. But the letter’s sharp tone and sweeping demands led the university to believe that reconciliation was unlikely.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nAs The New York Times put it, the episode has triggered “a tectonic battle between one of the country’s most prestigious universities and a US President.”\n\nWhat had happened?\n\nThe April 11 letter demanded sweeping changes at the university, including banning face masks, dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, and cooperating with immigration authorities. Harvard officials saw the demands as highly intrusive and publicly vowed to resist.\n\nHarvard President Alan Garber issued a firm response, saying, “The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.” The university has since retained Republican-aligned attorneys William Burck and Robert Hur, who argue that the administration’s demands are unconstitutional and violate First Amendment protections.\n\nThe Trump administration retaliated by freezing $2.2 billion in federal grants and $60 million in multi-year contracts awarded to Harvard. One member of the task force publicly criticised the university’s stance, accusing it of perpetuating “a troubling entitlement mindset” regarding federal funds.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nTrump went further, calling for Harvard’s tax-exempt status to be revoked. According to The Washington Post, the administration even asked the Internal Revenue Service’s top attorney to consider taking action.\n\nTax-exempt status, granted by the IRS, allows institutions like Harvard to avoid paying federal income tax. In return, they must refrain from political activity and ensure their income does not benefit individuals or shareholders. Legal experts noted that the president is barred from directly ordering IRS investigations, and no evidence has surfaced that Harvard has violated any rules.\n\nAccording to a report by Guardian, White House spokesperson stated that “any forthcoming actions by the IRS are conducted independently of the President,” and added that any existing reviews of Harvard’s tax status were initiated before Trump’s public comments.\n\nThe standoff has came up amid the increasing scrutiny of elite universities in the United States. While some institutions, like Columbia University, have reportedly complied with federal demands in exchange for restored funding, Harvard’s refusal has drawn praise from free speech advocates—and condemnation from administration officials.",

    "content": "A sheet metal apprentice with over a decade in the US, Abrego Garcia was deported under the Trump administration over unsubstantiated claims of MS-13 gang affiliation.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nJudges all the way up to the Supreme Court have ruled that Garcia was deported in error and that the US government should help “facilitate” his return to his home in Maryland.\n\nNo criminal charges have ever been brought against him in the US, and his legal team has consistently denied the allegations but White House has said that he “will never live” in the country again.\n\nWho is Kilmar Abrego Garcia?\n\nBorn in Los Nogales, El Salvador, in July 1995, Abrego Garcia grew up amid gang threats and extortion. At 16, he fled to the US in 2012, seeking safety and a better future. Settling in Maryland with his US citizen brother, he eventually married a US citizen, became a father of three, and joined a local trade union as a sheet metal apprentice.\n\nArrest\n\nHis legal troubles began in March 2019 when he was detained outside a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland. Authorities accused him and three other men of gang affiliation, based on clothing and a tip from an unnamed source. But no charges were filed, and records later revealed inconsistencies in the police documentation. One of the arresting officers, Ivan Mendez, was later convicted of misconduct in a separate case.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nDespite the allegations, an immigration judge granted Abrego Garcia protection from deportation, citing a “well-founded fear” of persecution by gangs in El Salvador. He was granted withholding of removal status and allowed to remain in the US under supervision.\n\nOn March 15, 2025, Abrego Garcia was suddenly deported to El Salvador in violation of the judge’s order. The Biden administration has since argued it lacks jurisdiction to return him, despite being instructed by a federal judge—and later the Supreme Court—to “facilitate” his return.\n\nHe is now imprisoned in one of El Salvador’s megaprison facilities. His wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, insists he is a victim of wrongful deportation, describing him as a hardworking family man.\n\nMeeting with US senator\n\nOn April 17, Abrego Garcia was briefly released from prison to meet US Senator Chris Van Hollen, marking his first contact with anyone outside prison since his detention. “He said he felt very sad about being in a prison because he had not committed any crimes,” Van Hollen shared. The senator later called the deportation an “illegal abduction.”\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nHowever, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele confirmed afterward that Garcia would remain behind bars, though he had been declared in good health.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has continued to level allegations against him, including a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop where human trafficking was suspected—but again, no charges were filed. DHS also referenced a 2021 temporary restraining order filed and later dropped by his wife. She defended her husband, saying, “No one is perfect… That is not a justification for ICE’s action of abducting him and deporting him.”",

    "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/world/jd-vance-vatican-following-remarkable-papal-rebuke-trumps-migrant-crackdown-9953307/",
    "content": "The Holy See has responded cautiously to the Trump administration, in keeping with its tradition of diplomatic neutrality. It has expressed alarm over the administration’s crackdown on migrants and cuts in international aid while insisting on peaceful resolutions to the war in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n“It is clear that the approach of the current US administration is very different from what we are used to and, especially in the West, from what we have relied on for many years,” Parolin told La Repubblica on the eve of the Vance visit.\n\nAs the US pushes to end the war in Ukraine, Parolin reaffirmed Kyiv’s right to its territorial integrity and insisted that any peace deal must not be “imposed” on Ukraine but “is built patiently, day by day, with dialogue and mutual respect”.\n\nVance was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St. Peter’s Basilica after meeting with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni.\n\nPapal rebuke on migration\n\nFrancis and Vance have tangled sharply over migration and the Trump administration’s plans to deport migrants en masse. Francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative US Catholic Church.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nVance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, identifies with a small Catholic intellectual movement, viewed by some critics as having reactionary or authoritarian leanings, that is often called “postliberal”.\n\nPostliberals share some longstanding Catholic conservative views, such as opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. They envision a counterrevolution in which they take over government bureaucracy and institutions like universities from within, replacing entrenched “elites” with their own and acting upon their vision of the “common good”.\n\nJust days before he was hospitalised in February, Francis blasted the Trump administration’s deportation plans, warning that they would deprive migrants of their inherent dignity. In a letter to US bishops, Francis also appeared to respond to Vance directly for having claimed that Catholic doctrine justified such policies.\n\nA Latin concept of love\n\nVance had defended the administration’s America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin as “ordo amoris.” He has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care — to family first, followed by neighbour, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere.\n\nIn his February 10 letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance’s understanding of the concept.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n“Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,” he wrote.\n\n“The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the Good Samaritan,’ that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.” Vance has acknowledged Francis’ criticism but has said he would continue to defend his views. During a February 28 appearance at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance didn’t address the issue specifically but called himself a “baby Catholic” and acknowledged there are “things about the faith that I don’t know”.\n\nWhile he had criticised Francis on social media in the past, Vance recently has posted prayers for Francis’ recovery.\n\nOn Friday, Vance, his wife and three young children had front-row seats at the Vatican’s Good Friday service in St. Peter’s, a two-hour solemn commemoration featuring Latin and Italian readings. Francis did not attend.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nBut the pope has begun receiving visitors, including King Charles III, and this week ventured out of the Vatican to meet with prisoners at Rome’s central jail to keep a Holy Thursday appointment ministering to the most marginalised.\n\nHe has named other cardinals to preside over Easter services this weekend, but officials haven’t ruled out a possible brief greeting with Vance.\n\n“I’m grateful every day for this job, but particularly today, where my official duties have brought me to Rome on Good Friday,” Vance posted on X. “I wish all Christians all over the world, but particularly those back home in the US, a blessed Good Friday.”",

    "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/world/us-travel-advisory-bangladesh-crime-terrorism-govt-employees-9952980/",
    "content": "“Reconsider travel to Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism. Some areas have increased risk,” the advisory by the US State Department read.\n\nThis comes amid the escalating law and order situation in Bangladesh after months of communal violence that began in the month of July last year. Communal clashes against the government led by then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee Dhaka, toppling her Awami League’s 16-year regime. At least 300 people were reported to be dead amid the agitation. This was followed by the formation of an interim government in the country, with Mohammad Yunus as its interim chief advisor.\n\nTo those travelling to the Chittagong Hill tracts, the department said: “Prior approval from the Government of Bangladesh’s Ministry of Home Affairs Office of Public Safety is required if you plan to travel to these areas. Due to the risks, US government employees working in Bangladesh are prohibited from traveling to the region. Do not travel to these areas for any reason.”\n\nThe US has also warned of changing conditions in Bangladesh, thus, asking the citizens to avoid all kinds of demonstrations and political gatherings, “even peaceful ones, since they could turn violent with little or no warning.” It also urged them to closely monitor local media for latest events and be prepared to adjust plans.\n\nTravellers should be aware of petty crimes such as pickpocketing in crowded areas, the advisory stated. Crimes such as muggings, burglaries, assaults, and illegal drug trafficking constitute the majority of criminal activity in Bangladesh’s major cities, but there are no indications foreigners are being targeted because of their nationality.\n\nOn US govt employees in Bangladesh\n\nThe advisory also entailed guidelines for US government employees working in Bangladesh, prohibiting them from non-essential travel within Dhaka outside of the diplomatic enclave.\n\nThey are also required to “obtain special authorization to travel outside of Dhaka. Authorization is not required for travel to Cox’s Bazar or Sylhet,” it stated.\n\nUnderlining the risk of terrorist violence, the US government said that they “may have limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in Bangladesh, particularly outside of Dhaka,” while citing “travel restrictions, a lack of infrastructure, and limited host government emergency response resources.”\n\n“Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Get to a safe area and report any criminal incident to local authorities. Enroll in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) to receive alerts including updates on consular services and so it is easier to locate you in an emergency,” the State Department highlighted. In addition, it recommended travellers to the country to purchase insurance.",

    "content": "Congress’s Digvijaya Singh alleged that Baba Ramdev, while promoting Patanjali's Gulab Sharbat, indirectly targeted Rooh Afza by implying that proceeds from its sale were used to fund madrasas and mosques — terming it “sharbat jihad.”\n\nYoga guru Baba Ramdev on Friday defended his “sharbat jihad\" remark, saying he did not name any specific brand or community, even as criticism mounted over what was criticised as a communal statement allegedly aimed at the popular drink Rooh Afza.\n\n“I haven’t taken anybody’s name, but the Rooh Afza people took ‘sharbat jihad’ on themselves… this means they are doing this ‘jihad’. If they are dedicated to Islam and are building masjids and madrasas, then they should be happy. However, the Sanatanis should understand… If someone has a problem with this, then let it be,\" he said.\n\nThe controversy erupted after Baba Ramdev’s recent statement drew criticism from Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, who filed a police complaint in Bhopal seeking an FIR against Ramdev for allegedly inciting religious hatred and hurting communal sentiments.\n\nIn his complaint, Singh invoked sections 196(1)(a) and 299 of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, 2023, along with relevant provisions of the Information Technology Act.\n\nThe Congress leader alleged that Ramdev, while promoting Patanjali’s Gulab Sharbat, indirectly targeted Rooh Afza by implying that proceeds from its sale were used to fund madrasas and mosques — terming it “sharbat jihad.\"\n\nSingh highlighted a video allegedly from Baba Ramdev’s official X account, claiming it aimed to stir communal sentiments to promote Patanjali Ayurved’s products.\n\n“This statement of Ramdev is hurtful, full of animosity, and intended to provoke religious sentiments,\" Singh said. “Calling the sale of Rooh Afza ‘sharbat jihad’ is not just defamatory, but unconstitutional.\"\n\nThe Congress leader also alleged that Baba Ramdev built a massive business empire by using religion and nationalism to promote his products, many of which, Singh claimed, have either failed to meet quality standards or have been banned by courts.\n\n“The entire country knows Ramdev was pointing at the Hamdard company, even though he didn’t name it directly,\" Singh said. “Opposing a Sharbat just because the owner is Muslim is hate speech, plain and simple.\"\n\nSingh further threatened to approach the court if the police don’t register an FIR within a week. “I have demanded that an FIR be registered under the existing laws,\" he said.\n\nAdditional Deputy Commissioner of police Rashmi Agrawal confirmed that Singh’s complaint had been received. “We are probing the complaint and will take action as per the findings,\" she said.\n\nLocation :\n\nMathura, India, India",

ISRO May Send Them To Space Station With Axiom-4 Mission\n\nGroup Captain Shukla will pilot the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft to the ISS, becoming the first Indian to live and work on the Space Station.\n\nAs India approaches one of its most ambitious space endeavours, the experiment will feature tardigrades, notoriously resilient “water bears\".\n\nThe Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is preparing to be part of a unique experiment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as Wing Commander Shubhanshu Shukla gears up to fly on the Axiom-4 mission.\n\nThe Indian astronaut will be on a 14-day-long mission to live and work in zero gravity. He will be conducting several experiments during his stay, and one of the most important among them is the Voyager Tardigrades experiment.\n\nGroup Captain Shukla will pilot the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft to the ISS, becoming the first Indian to live and work on the Space Station.\n\nWhat Are Tardigrades Or Water Bears?\n\nTardigrades, nicknamed “water bears\" or “moss piglets\", are tiny, eight-legged micro-animals renowned for their almost indestructible biology. Measuring barely 0.3 mm to 0.5 mm in length, they require a microscope to be seen.\n\nTardigrades have eight legs with tiny claws, segmented bodies, and a tough cuticle, characterised by their slow and lumbering movements.\n\nTardigrades can be found almost everywhere on Earth, including mosses, lichens, soil, leaf litter, freshwater, marine environments, high mountains, deep seas, hot springs, and even polar ice.\n\nWhat Is the Voyager Tardigrades Experiment?\n\nThe Voyager Tardigrades experiment is one of seven Indian scientific studies scheduled for the ISS. It will investigate the revival, survival, and reproduction of tardigrades sent to the ISS.\n\nAccording to a brief by Axiom Space, the experiment will study tardigrade revival, egg-laying and hatching in space, and compare gene expression patterns between space-flown and ground-control populations.\n\nThe research aims to uncover molecular mechanisms behind tardigrades’ resilience, shedding light on life’s limits in extreme environments. This knowledge could inform future space exploration and help develop biotechnology applications on Earth.\n\nNeed To Study Tardigrades In Space\n\nTardigrades’ ability to survive extreme conditions like space vacuum, radiation, and temperature fluctuations makes them ideal for space research, offering insights into life’s survival mechanisms.\n\nBy understanding how tardigrades protect and repair their DNA, scientists hope to find ways to safeguard astronauts during long space missions where radiation levels are much higher than on Earth.\n\nTardigrades’ ability to enter suspended animation could inspire ways to preserve biological materials or even humans for extended space missions.\n\nThe findings of the experiment could shape the plans and advancement of India’s Gaganyaan Mission.\n\nLocation :",

Moreover, the victim’s younger sister, who was a witness to her brother’s death, was allegedly abducted and trafficked by goons working for the village chief.\n\nIn an emotional testimony to the Uttar Pradesh Women’s Commission Chairperson, Babita Singh Chauhan, the parents of the trio said the perpetrators demanded Rs 20 lakh for the return of their younger sister. After the horrifying ordeal, the family was also evicted from the village, according to a report by Amar Ujala.\n\nThe grieving mother alleged that the head of the village had his eye on the land owned by the family and he, along with his relatives, allegedly raped their older daughter, who was a minor. The woman’s son, who studied in Class 7, was a witness to the crime but was shot dead four days before the hearing.\n\nThis incident was witnessed by the woman’s younger daughter, but she was abducted on December 2, 2024. Additionally, the village chief plotted with the police to implicate the woman’s brother in a false case and sent him to jail.\n\nThe family broke down while sharing their agony and alleged that the police refused to listen to their problems and instead started troubling them.

Several people also lambasted the government for failing to prosecute rape accused, which contributes to the rise in such cases.\n\nLocation :\n\nAgra, India, India",

Roy, a resident of Basudebpur village, was abducted from his house and beaten to death by goons on Friday.\n\n“We have noted with distress the abduction and brutal killing of Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a Hindu minority leader in Bangladesh. This killing follows a pattern of systematic persecution of Hindu minorities under the interim government, even as the perpetrators of previous such events roam with impunity,\" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on X.\n\nIn a strongly worded statement, the External Affairs Ministry condemned the incident and reminded the interim government of Bangladesh to “live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities, including Hindus, without inventing excuses or making distinctions.\"\n\nWhat Happened To Bhabesh Chandra Roy?\n\nBhabesh Chandra Roy was the vice-president of the Biral unit of the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad. He was also a prominent leader in the Hindu community of the area. His wife told local media that he was abducted by bike-born assailants after receiving a phone call on Friday. Witnesses saw him being taken to Naxalbari village, where he was brutally beaten to death.\n\nThe attackers reportedly sent his unconscious body back to his home in a van.

Over the past months, there have been repeated and deeply disturbing instances of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh, from desecration of Hindu temples to targeted attack on the homes and businesses of minorities. This pattern of intimidation and brutality cannot be ignored,\" said Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on X.\n\nThe Congress urged the Indian government to take up the matter with the highest urgency and prevail upon the interim government in Bangladesh to ensure a swift and transparent investigation and bring the culprits to justice.\n\nThis comes amid a rise in attacks against the Hindu minorities in Bangladesh following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina’s government, which has strained ties between India and Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus’ interim government in Dhaka.

Both the primary Runway 09/27 and secondary Runway 14/32 will be non-operational during this period.\n\nThe scheduled maintenance is a vital part of CSMIA’s larger monsoon contingency and preparedness plan, aimed at ensuring continued safety and seamless operations during the upcoming rainy season. Recognising the importance of early communication, CSMIA issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) a full six months in advance, allowing airlines and other stakeholders ample time to adjust their schedules and minimize inconvenience to passengers.\n\nCSMIA’s airside infrastructure spans over 1,033 acres and this annual upkeep is crucial for maintaining the health and efficiency of its operational surfaces. As part of the maintenance routine, teams of technical experts and engineers will conduct thorough inspections to assess surface wear and tear, repair runway markings, clean drainage systems, and implement preventive measures against waterlogging—factors critical to ensuring safe landings and take-offs during the heavy monsoon rains typical in Mumbai.\n\nTo enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the operation, CSMIA will deploy advanced monitoring technologies to oversee the entire maintenance process in real-time. The airport management has also worked in close coordination with multiple stakeholders, including airline operators and regulatory authorities, to ensure the work is completed smoothly and within the scheduled six-hour window.\n\n“This planned exercise is a part of our long-standing commitment to operational safety and infrastructure resilience. The pre-monsoon maintenance helps us stay ahead of seasonal challenges, while minimising disruptions for passengers and airlines alike,\" said a CSMIA spokesperson.\n\nThe airport has advised travellers flying in or out of Mumbai on May 8 to check with their airlines for possible changes in flight timings and to plan their journeys accordingly. CSMIA continues to set benchmarks in aviation safety and service excellence by proactively investing in infrastructure maintenance and ensuring uninterrupted operations, even in challenging weather conditions.\n\nLocation :",

    "content": "The male coalition will be moved from Kuno to Gandhi Sagar on April 20. Only 12 adult African cheetahs and 14 captive-born now remain in India out of the 20 airlifted over the two years\n\nWith Project Cheetah in its third year, the government has now approved the introduction of African felines to another site in Madhya Pradesh – Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary. As per the plan, a male coalition—two cheetahs—will be relocated from Kuno National Park to Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary this Sunday.\n\n“We will release two males initially and see how it goes. The next steps will be decided following that. Adequate arrangements have already been made, and the enclosed area is about 15.5 sq km large,\" said Subhoranjan Sen, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF –Wildlife), Madhya Pradesh.\n\nThis follows the release of 17 cheetahs—six adults and 11 of their cubs—into the wild early this year after extended captivity, preceded by multiple recaptures and tranquilisations. So far, the felines have ventured far and wide in hunt for prey, which has also dwindled around Kuno as acknowledged in the last action report.\n\nThe decision was taken during a review meeting of Project Cheetah chaired by Union environment minister Bhupendra Yadav and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Dr Mohan Yadav on Friday. “We are moving towards newer possibilities, with two sites in MP where cheetahs will be hosted. Apart from that, we are also working towards more rescue shelters, veterinary centres not only for cheetahs, but other animals in the state and other facilities to improve human-animal interaction,\" said Yadav.\n\nThe government’s ambitious multi-crore wildlife project to revive cheetah population in India began in September 2022 with import of 20 adult cheetahs from Namibia, and then South Africa to Kuno National Park. But only 12 adults survived, along with 14 captive-born cubs following deaths due to multiple causes.\n\nThe forest officials have now fenced an area of 64 sq km in Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary. All the leopards—competing carnivores which can be a natural threat to cheetahs—were captured and shifted outside although no direct conflict has been seen or observed between cheetahs and leopards so far at Kuno, according to officials.\n\nMeanwhile, negotiations are on with South Africa, Kenya and Botswana to import a third batch of cheetahs to India this year to supplement the current population.\n\nThis is also part of government’s long-term plan to set up an Inter-State Cheetah Conservation Complex in the Kuno-Gandhi Sagar landscape along the Madhya Pradesh-Rajasthan-Uttar Pradesh border for future cheetah population. A large part of this Inter-State Cheetah Conservation Complex is situated in the Chambal River basin, covering various districts in MP, Rajasthan, as well as Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThese multiple forest patches cumulatively cover an area of 10,500 sq km in MP and 6,500 sq km in Rajasthan. The target is still to establish a meta-population of 60-70 cheetahs in the next 25 years, with Gandhi Sagar Wildlife Sanctuary as the second site for translocation.\n\nLocation :\n\nMadhya Pradesh, India, India",

The 40-year-old from Aligarh recently became the talk of the two after she allegedly eloped with her would-be son-in-law. The duo had plans to flee to Nepal but the Uttar Pradesh police tracked them down just before they were about to cross the border.\n\nDevi, on the other hand, claimed they returned voluntarily after seeing “objectionable\" news reports about them, and told the police she wants to stay with her would-be son-in-law, 25-year-old Rahul Singh.\n\nA new video of the duo has surfaced on social media where reporters can be seen questioning the ‘couple’ seated in a car. A reporter is heard asking Rahul Singh, “You father says that he will not accept you, and will ostracize you. What do you have to say?\"\n\nThe 25-year-old replies that he does not want to comment on the issue. Another person with mobile phone asks, “Aapne kaise inko patni banaya hai (how have you made her your wife — court marriage or temple)? To this, Singh says, “Everything is almost final, and we will stay together.\"\n\nThe reporter asserts that the method of marriage be specified. A visibly troubled Rahul Singh says, “Court…court..\" The reporters tried to tell him that it wasn’t possible till Anita Devi gets divorced from her first husband. Distressed by the questions, Rahul Singh tries to shut the car door.\n\nThe video sparked comments from social media users, who said that considering the man is young, he will eventually lose interest in the 40-year-old. A user speculated if there was more to the story. He did not seem convinced with the case being just a matter of eloping.\n\nAnita Devi’s daughter, Shivani, was scheduled to get married to Rahul on April 16. The preparations were in full swing when Devi disappeared from her home with cash and jewellery on April 8. Aligarh police said that around the same time, Rahul’s phone was also switched off and became untraceable.\n\nThe matter came to light when Devi’s husband Jitendra Kumar filed a missing persons complaint.\n\n“I never imagined my wife running away with our daughter’s fiancé like this. This is not just a betrayal, it is an attack on the honour of our entire family,\" Jitendra said was quoted by The Print.\n\n“Now people are calling and telling me about Rahul’s past doings. Earlier also he had eloped with two young women by luring them, but then his family members somehow managed to get the matter suppressed,\" the report further quoted him as saying. Police said Devi and Rahul belong to the Banjara scheduled tribe.\n\nDownload the News18 App to stay updated!\n\nLocation :\n\nAligarh, India, India\n\nFirst Published:\n\nApril 19, 2025, 11:39 IST",

    "content": "Residents under the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) will face low water pressure due to ongoing pipeline repair work.\n\nA major water pipeline managed by the Shahad Temghar Water Supply Authority (STEM), which supplies water to Thane, developed a leak around 12:30 PM on Friday, April 18. Prompt repair work was initiated by the authorities, but as a result, residents under the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) are expected to face low water pressure on April 18 and 19. The affected pipeline has been shut off temporarily to facilitate repairs. While officials remain hopeful about completing the work on time, Deputy City Engineer Vinod Pawar noted that the water supply may take a little longer to normalise in some areas.\n\nAreas that may face this issue include Mumbra, Retibundar, parts of Kalwa, Kharegaon, Saket, Rabodi, Uthalsar, Khopat, Ghodbunder Road, Gandhinagar, Pokhran Road No. 1 and 2, Indiranagar, Charai, Siddheshwar, Bhaskar Colony and Ghantali.\n\nAs per Mid Day, the TMC officials stated, “To carry out these urgent repairs, the water supply from the affected pipeline has been temporarily shut off. Residents are advised to use water wisely and store sufficient water in advance until the normal supply is restored.\"\n\nAccording to earlier Times of India reports, TMC has asked housing societies to take care of their own water systems by regularly checking their internal pipelines and water tanks, and fixing any leaks without delay, to make sure there is no overflow from overhead tanks. If any society is found wasting water, the supply of that specific building or society might be cut off.\n\nA spokesperson named Manoj Badgeri said, “As part of the directive, societies have been instructed to regularly inspect internal pipelines and tanks, promptly repair leaks, and prevent overhead tank overflow. If complaints are received and wastage is found, water connection of the building or society concerned will be disconnected. Potable water should not be used for non-essential purposes such as swimming pools.\"\n\nThis is the second time in a month that water-related maintenance has disrupted daily life for Thane residents. On April 9, the water supply was halted from 9 AM to 9 PM as part of earlier repair work. During that period, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) officials addressed a leak in the main water pipeline at the Mankoli Master Balancing Reservoir (MBR). Additionally, the team removed several unauthorised water connections discovered between the Pise and Temghar water treatment plants—key components of TMC’s water supply infrastructure.\n\nLocation :\n\nDelhi, India, India",

    "content": "Murshidabad Mayhem: A Week On, 70-Year-Old Bids Adieu To Ancestral Home In Search For Safety\n\nKrishna Chandra Pal and his wife recounted how an irate mob attacked their house, pelting diesel bombs, and looted their belongings, leaving them no choice but to leave the premises they once called home\n\nWhat would you do if you had to lock your house where your father and grandfather had lived and leave, packing your life in three bags? Sounds surreal? Surreal is the new normal for many in Murshidabad’s Samserganj area. Even as the administration is genuinely trying to bring back those who fled their houses in the aftermath of the communal violence after the anti-Waqf protest, many Hindus continue to leave.\n\nSeventy-year-old Krishna Chandra Pal in Digri area, very close to Jaffrabad village — where the father-and-son duo was hacked to death in the violence — is the latest addition to a long list of Hindu residents from the area who are forced to flee, sensing a lack of safety.\n\nCiting “upadrav\" or rampancy of “inn log\" — attackers allegedly from the Muslim community — he was preparing to leave when News18 caught up with him.\n\n“I am leaving because of the rampant behaviour of these people. They have torched houses and are threatening to kill us. So why would we stay back?\" asked Pal. Recounting the day when the anti-Waqf protest turned violent and later communal, he said “thousands\" attacked their house. “I escaped from the back gate. They were hurling diesel bombs. Look, traces of that are still there,\" he said, pointing towards the balcony. The iron grill of the balcony is uprooted. The house bears tell-tale signs of a rampage, with materials scattered all around.\n\nAs he, along with his wife Lily Pal and another family member, Pratima Pal, carried their bags to an e-rickshaw to leave, Lily looked back at the house and broke down. “When I came into the house as a new bride, I thought I would live and eventually die here. Never imagined that we would have to leave like this. But they didn’t let us live here. I used the backdoor to escape along with my three daughters,\" recounted Lily. She claimed the attackers threatened to kill them with diesel bombs.\n\nLily not only lost her confidence to stay back but also cash and gold jewellery. Interactions with a series of victims revealed a pattern to the rampage where before torching houses, the attackers went on a looting spree. “There were 100 grams of gold and Rs 3 lakh in cash in the house,\" Lily said, adding that everything was looted by the attackers.\n\n“I am leaving. I can’t live here. I feel terrified and dread a mob coming from any direction. We want a camp by the Border Security Force (BSF). Otherwise, we will not survive here,\" she added.\n\nThe ghost of the Murshidabad communal attack has left an indelible scar on Lily as well as many who have fled to different parts, with a sizable chunk of refugees in the adjoining Malda district where a relief camp has been opened for them. Both NCW chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar as well as Governor CV Ananda Bose met the victims in their relief camp to listen to their ordeal.\n\nResidents from the affected villages, including Jafrabad, Bedpara, Digri, have reason to believe that it was locals who perpetrated the attacks on the houses of Hindu families. Three people—Kalu Nawab, Dildar Nawab and Inzamul Haque—have been arrested for the murders of the father-son duo Haragobinda Das and Chandan Das. Haque, who is believed to be the mastermind of the double murders, is a resident of the neighbourhood where the killings took place and was apprehended from Suti area of the district late on Wednesday after night-long raids, Additional Director General (South Bengal) Supratim Sarkar said. This further bolsters the claim of victims and survivors, hinting at a ‘local hand’ as opposed to a ‘Bangladeshi link’.\n\nThe violence has also fractured the relationship between the two communities.\n\nHowever, TMC MLA from the area Amirul Islam thinks the situation has “improved\". Speaking to News18, Islam said, “Look, the situation has improved. It is gradually becoming normal. Those who went here and there have come back. We are trying to do our job. We are mending the water supply and electricity here… It (the violence) shouldn’t have happened. But it happened. We should maintain brotherhood. We have to live together.\" Even as Islam was speaking to News18, a local TMC leader tried to stop a visibly agitated Pal from leaving.\n\nAsked how he would allay fears of the likes of Pal, Islam said, “Everyone here is a good person… There is a panic in their minds. We are trying to make them understand that it’s their house and they should live here.’ Soon after the MLA left, Pal rebuked his wife for “wasting time inside\", hurriedly locked the doors and hopped onto the e-rickshaw to leave. As they left Digri, a despondent Lily Mandal could not help but look back at her house, one more time.\n\nLocation :\n\nMurshidabad, India, India",

    "content": "Last Updated:April 19, 2025, 12:42 IST\n\nThe husband and wife reportedly had an argument over accepting the child, following which the woman threatened to kill and lodge a fake dowry case against her husband if 'he does not accept her child'. Mahrajganj police said that they are investigating the matter.\n\nWhat began as a normal argument between a husband and wife took a shocking turn when the woman allegedly threatened to kill the man or frame him in a false dowry case. The incident occurred in Uttar Pradesh’s Maharajganj district and stemmed from a dispute over the woman’s pregnancy. Following the husband’s complaint, police intervened and have launched an investigation against the woman.\n\nAccording to the police complaint, the couple tied the knot in June 2022, but trouble reportedly began soon after. The husband alleged that his wife consistently refused to engage in any physical relationship, which left him distressed. He also claimed that she frequently visited her parents’ home in Uttar Pradesh’s Sant Kabir Nagar district. In November 2024, she allegedly left for her parental home once again—this time without informing him.\n\nIn February 2025, the man reached out to his wife, requesting her to return home. However, it was only in April that a twist unfolded, when the woman complained of stomach pain and was taken to the hospital, where doctors revealed she was 14 weeks pregnant. Shocked by the revelation, the man sought confirmation from multiple medical professionals, only to receive the same diagnosis each time. Upon confrontation, the woman allegedly confessed that the child was not his. She then reportedly threatened him—demanding he accept her, or else she would either “kill him or falsely implicate him in a dowry case\".\n\nWith the matter now under investigation, the Maharajganj police confirmed that a case has been registered at the local police station, and further legal proceedings are currently underway.\n\nMeanwhile, social media users quickly reacted in the comments, expressing shock and frustration over the situation. One user wrote, “Now is the time for gender equality law—where else can innocent people turn? Scrap gender-biased laws and bring in gender-neutral legislation to empower all citizens, regardless of gender.\" Another commented, “The husband should just accept his fate, reconcile with his wife, and raise the child—because legally, he may have no other choice in India.\"\n\nInternet users reiterated how the Indian judiciary will leave the husband to bear the responsibility of the child, even if he files for a divorce. One wrote, “But the court will say it’s yours. Like if somebody else is driving your vehicle & has an accident, then you are responsible as the LEGAL owner of the vehicle …like here also you are LEGAL HUSBAND so it’s yours.\"\n\nThe incident surfaced shortly after a similar case was reported from Uttar Pradesh’s Gonda district, where a woman allegedly threatened to kill her husband for opposing her extramarital affair. As per reports, she even referenced the chilling Meerut murder case and warned her husband that he could meet the same fate.\n\nLocation :\n\nMahrajganj, India, India\n\nFirst Published:\n\nApril 19, 2025, 09:39 IST",

This came after rains lashed parts of the national capital on Friday evening, while dust storms, lightning and gusts hit parts of the NCR region, including Noida and Ghaziabad.\n\n“The sky will be partly cloudy, becoming generally cloudy by evening, with very light rain or drizzle expected, accompanied by thunderstorms, lightning, and dust storms, along with sustained surface winds reaching speeds of 40–50 km/h and gusts up to 60 km/h,\" wrote the IMD in its Saturday bulletin.\n\nRain and gusty winds brought some relief from the heat in Delhi yesterday. The national capital recorded a maximum temperature of 41 degrees Celsius, which is 4.2 degrees above normal. The minimum temperature was 25.6 degrees Celsius.\n\n“A fresh cloud cluster has entered Delhi, causing very light to light rainfall and gusty winds of 30 to 40 kmph. It is likely to move across the city with similar intensity,\" the weather department said. Data showed Narela, Pitampura and Mayur Vihar recording 0.5 mm of rainfall.\n\nThe temperature fell from 36 degrees Celsius to 27 degrees Celsius in Pusa, Pitampura and Mayur Vihar recording a drop from 37 degrees Celsius to 27 degrees Celsius.

Meanwhile, the air quality at 4 pm on Friday was recorded in the “poor\" category, with an Air Quality Index (AQI) reading of 219.\n\nMercury Crosses 45 In Rajasthan, Heat Wave Alert In Five Districts\n\nMeanwhile, Rajasthan continued to experience sweltering heat as the maximum temperature crossed 45 degrees Celsius in several parts of the state. However, the meteorological department predicted a possibility of strong winds and dust storms from Saturday, bringing some relief from the heat.\n\nAccording to the Meteorological Department, the weather remained dry in the state on Friday. Due to this, many areas in the state reported heatwave to severe heatwave conditions. Talking about temperatures, the highest maximum temperatures in the state were recorded in Sri Ganganagar and Churu, both at 45.4°C.\n\nThe mercury touched 45.2 degrees Celsius in Chittorgarh, 45.1 degrees Celsius in Vanasthali and Kota, 44.9 degrees Celsius in Pilani, 44.4 degrees Celsius in Barmer, 43.5 degrees Celsius in Jaisalmer, 42.6 degrees Celsius in Sangaria and 42.5 degrees Celsius in Fatehpur.\n\nThe Meteorological Department and the Health Department have issued alerts and guidelines for protection against heat waves in at least five districts.\n\nOver the next 48 hours, some parts of the Jodhpur and Bikaner divisions are likely to experience strong winds with dust storms, blowing at speeds of 30–40 km/h. After that, a drop of 2 to 4 degrees in both maximum and minimum temperatures is expected, and heatwave conditions may persist in isolated areas of the Jodhpur, Bikaner, and Kota divisions.\n\nLocation :",

She then called her lover, Pintu, to the house.\n\nBoth Rekha and Pintu strangled Singh with a rope and then hung his body, attempting to pass off the murder as a suicide.

We are investigating all possible angles,\" said Additional Superintendent of Police Mukesh Chandra Mishra.\n\nThe couple was sent to jail after a medical examination on Friday.\n\nA case of murder has been registered against Rekha and Pintu at the Fatehganj Paschimi police station based on a complaint filed by the victim’s brother, Ashok.\n\nIn his complaint, Ashok claimed that his brother had found out about his wife’s affair with Pintu, after which the two plotted and carried out his murder.\n\n“They first gave him poison. When he became unconscious, they strangled him with a rope and then used the same rope to hang his body from the ceiling to make it look like suicide,\" the FIR stated.\n\nIn another chilling incident from Uttar Pradesh, a woman and her lover allegedly killed her husband and placed a snake near the body in an attempt to mislead investigators in Meerut.\n\nThe murder also comes on the heels of another gruesome case in which Saurabh Shukla was killed by his wife, Muskaan Rastogi, and her lover.

He will fly to ISS on a privately funded commercial mission. India has reportedly paid over $60 million for the mission, which will launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket with a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule carrying a four-person crew, lifting off from Florida’s Kennedy Space Centre.\n\nAfter reviewing the work of the Department of Space and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), Union Minister of State Jitendra Singh said, “Group Captain Shukla’s journey is more than just a flight – it’s a signal that India is stepping boldly into a new era of space exploration.\"\n\nALSO READ: How PM Modi’s Vision Is Propelling India Into Global Big League Of Defence, Space & Tech\n\nWhy Is This Project Important?\n\nSingh said Group Captain Shukla’s mission, scheduled for May, marks a milestone in India’s expanding international space collaborations. He stressed that the collaboration with international partners and the strategic momentum of projects like Gaganyaan reflect India’s commitment to becoming a global leader in space technology.\n\nThe commander of the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission will be former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who now works for Axiom Space. The other two crew members are Slawosz Uznanski from Poland, who is a European Space Agency astronaut and will be a mission specialist, and Hungary’s Tibor Kapu, who will also have the same role. Group Captain Shukla will be the mission’s pilot.\n\nHis journey aboard the Axiom-4 mission is expected to provide critical hands-on experience in spaceflight operations, launch protocols, microgravity adaptation, and emergency preparedness – all essential for India’s crewed space ambitions, an official statement said.\n\nShukla’s flight is strategically significant as it focuses on operational readiness and global integration and underscores India’s growing engagement with public-private international partnerships in space. Union Minister Singh said these efforts were not only scientific in nature but also aligned with the vision of a developed and self-reliant India.\n\nApart from this, ISRO is also set to launch the NISAR satellite, developed jointly with NASA, in June on board the GSLV-Mark 2 rocket, said Singh. In the following month, the agency will put BlueBird Block-2 satellites of US-based AST SpaceMobile Inc. in orbit using the heavy-lift LVM-3 rocket.\n\nISRO is also set to launch the PSLV-C61 mission, carrying the EOS-09 satellite, which features a C-band synthetic aperture radar for high-resolution Earth imaging, under all weather conditions, day or night.\n\nWho Is Subhanshu Shukla?\n\nA decorated test pilot with the Indian Air Force, Group Captain Shukla, 40, is the youngest of the ISRO astronauts. He was shortlisted under ISRO’s Human Spaceflight Program and is among the top contenders for the Gaganyaan mission.\n\nHailing from Lucknow, Group Captain Shukla is an alumnus of City Montessori School in Aliganj. Commissioned as a fighter pilot in 2006, he has accumulated over 16 years of service and more than 2,000 flying hours.\n\nHe was commissioned into the Indian Air Force on June 17, 2006, and describes his career as a “rollercoaster ride.\" He has excelled in his field, becoming a fighter combat leader and test pilot with experience in various aircraft, including the Su-30MKI, MIG-21, MIG-29, Jaguar, and Hawk.\n\n(with PTI inputs)\n\nDownload the News18 App to stay updated!\n\nLocation :\n\nFirst Published:\n\nApril 19, 2025, 07:24 IST",

    "content": "A Lot Of Water Has Flown Under It, But Delhi's Minto Bridge Is Finally Getting 'Rain-Ready' After Big Makeover\n\nThe issue of waterlogging at Minto Bridge could be traced back to the 1950s, and almost every year, similar claims were made by the governments and agencies. Yet, the picture remains the same every time Delhi witnesses a good amount of rain\n\nA flooded Minto Bridge, with a vehicle or two barely visible under the water, is an image that reappears every year when the monsoon hits the national capital. The historic railway bridge, built in the 1930s, has not just seen a lot of water flooding under it, but also the flood of politics, blame games, and agencies running away from their responsibilities.\n\nHowever, the picture is set to change this monsoon. The Public Works Department (PWD) in Delhi is undertaking some much-needed and awaited repairs to prevent waterlogging ahead of the monsoon.\n\nOn Friday, the top ministers from the Delhi cabinet, including chief minister Rekha Gupta, inspected the bridge and waterlogging points in Delhi.\n\nGupta, while speaking to the media, said that they have also used tankers to test the capacity of the pipes and pumps. She said the tankers poured water on the road, which was cleared within minutes.\n\nRecalling past incidents, she said last time the situation was so bad that even the pump operator could not reach the location, and the pump was also submerged in rainwater. She also recalled the image of buses being submerged in waterlogging under the bridge.\n\n“We have started the preparation well in advance and have tested by using tanker water. Automatic pumps have been installed under the bridge. These pumps will start working as soon as the water reaches a certain level. A 2.5 km long pipeline has been built that will take all the water away. All the waterlogging points in the city will get dedicated care to ensure the public does not suffer in the rain,\" she said.\n\nThe issue of waterlogging at Minto Bridge could be traced back to the 1950s, and almost every year, similar claims were made by the governments and agencies. Yet, the picture remains the same every time Delhi witnesses a good amount of rain.\n\nThe railway bridge has Connaught Place on one side and the New Delhi station on the other.\n\nAccording to a Delhi government official, there were talks to build another railway bridge and replace this one.\n\n“But this bridge has been a tough spot, as it is a heritage structure. This cannot be redeveloped. The bridge was built in the 1930s. The height was low, and the design was made keeping in mind the needs of that time. But over the years, traffic and transportation needs have changed. However, the height of the bridge remained unchanged,\" the official said, requesting anonymity.\n\nShaped like a bowl, the road under the bridge is prone to heavy water accumulation.\n\n“Also, all the structures around the bridge are new and are at a greater height. The bottom part of the bowl-like road turned deeper over the years,\" the official explained.\n\nIn 2020, the PWD floated a tender for a 3-km-long drainage system for Minto Road, Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) Marg, and its catchment area. Two new drains were built, but the situation did not change.\n\nNow, the PWD is building another 1,000 mm diameter drainage three metres underground. This will eventually be connected to a larger drainage system.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Delhi cabinet minister Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma on Friday said that officials have been instructed to ensure that all essential tasks are completed on time so that no waterlogging issues arise at any location during this monsoon season.\n\nThe government, he said, has given orders for strict monitoring of waterlogging.\n\n“In 2023, Delhi police had identified 308 waterlogging-prone spots, which were reduced to 194 in 2024. Most of these spots fall under the jurisdiction of the PWD. Work is ongoing toward resolution. Desilting of drains is being accelerated, pump stations are being installed at necessary locations, and several pump stations are being automated,\" he said.\n\nVerma also said the shortage of pump operators is being addressed through new appointments, and at places where drain construction is underway, temporary solutions are being ensured by installing pump sets.\n\nLocation :",

    "title": "Why Harvard’s ₹4.4 Lakh Crore Endowment Can’t Shield It From Donald Trump’s Crackdown",
    "link": "https://www.news18.com/world/why-harvards-4-4-lakh-crore-endowment-cant-shield-it-from-donald-trumps-crackdown-ws-kl-9305427.html",
    "content": "Harvard University’s finances have become the latest target of the Trump administration – and experts say the hits could hurt.\n\nIn the past week, the administration has threatened Harvard University’s funding from multiple angles: freezing billions in federal funds, and potentially revoking its non-profit tax status and its ability to enroll foreign students.\n\nMore than $2.2 billion in federal grants and contracts have been frozen and even more could be siphoned away if the other pressures materialize. Harvard Medical School is preparing for possible layoffs and the School of Public Health, which received three stop-work orders on research this week, is winding down two leases in off-campus buildings.\n\nWhile Harvard is the nation’s oldest and richest university with a massive $53.2 billion endowment – a deep coffer that could help cushion any cuts – experts and a review of Harvard’s financials show the challenges with digging into that endowment and the seriousness of the Trump administration’s pressure.\n\n“This threat is huge. It’s not by any means something to shrug off and it’s not going to be only Harvard,\" said Sandy Baum, senior fellow at the Urban Institute who specializes in higher education finance.\n\nEven with its mammoth endowment, Harvard says it has been funding nearly two-thirds of its operating expenses from other sources, including federal research grants and student tuition.\n\nThe university has seen a surge in donations following the administration’s funding freeze, with $1.14 million collected in under 48 hours, student newspaper The Harvard Crimson reported, citing a giving update by Harvard Alumni Affairs and Development, though the amount is far less than the funds that were pulled.\n\nNow Harvard, which has emerged as a symbol of the Trump resistance after refusing to follow policy demands, will need to weigh its options.\n\n“One of the hard things is everybody thinks ‘Harvard, they’re so rich it doesn’t matter.’ The fact is, Harvard is rich. It does put them in a better position to manage this situation, but they don’t have an indefinite amount of money, and not all of their funding is accessible,\" Baum said.\n\nWhy universities don’t dig into their endowments\n\nEndowments can’t be accessed at any time like bank accounts. They have to be maintained in perpetuity and are largely restricted.\n\nAbout 80% of Harvard’s $53.2 billion endowment is earmarked for financial aid, scholarships, faculty chairs, academic programs or other projects, according to the school. The remaining 20% is intended to sustain the institution for years to come.\n\nTapping into the endowment may be impractical for several reasons, including that some of it is legally restricted, but also because some of the unrestricted money is tied up in illiquid assets, such as in hedge funds, private equity and real estate that can’t be easily sold.\n\nEndowment gifts are intended to benefit both current and future generations at the university, meaning Harvard can only spend a small fraction each year.\n\nHarvard, like many universities, has directed an annual payout rate of about 5-5.5% of its endowment’s annual market value, which in fiscal year 2024 resulted in roughly $2.4 billion to fund its operations. The Harvard Corporation, which runs the university, controls whether to increase or decrease that percentage.\n\n“If there ever has been a moment to dip into the endowment, it’s right now because if they don’t, they’re going to lose their character as an institution,\" said Baum, who added that decision is not without risks. “It’s obvious no matter how much money you have, if you spend at an incredibly rapid rate, it’s going to go down.\"\n\nHarvard has not said if it intends to reach deeper into its endowment as it weighs its next moves. CNN has reached out to the university for comment.\n\nDrawing down on the endowment could mean less money for future generations of Harvard students – a possibility universities prefer to avoid, according to George S. McClellan, professor of higher education at the University of Mississippi and the co-author of “Budgets and Financial Management in Higher Education.\"\n\n“It’s generally considered a very bad thing if you have to dip into what’s called the ‘corpus’ of the endowment,\" McClellan said, using a term for the “body\" of the endowment funds.\n\n“Generally speaking, that’s one of the last things a higher-ed institution wants to do.\"\n\nUniversities have however faced tough times before and adjusted. In 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold, Harvard Corporation, which runs the university, dipped deeper into the endowment, approving a 2.5% distribution rate increase to the amount of money the university could tap into.\n\nThe university spends billions each year\n\nThe university’s revenue predominately comes from philanthropy, which accounted for 45% of $6.5 billion in total operating revenues in 2024. Another 21% of revenue came from education, including tuition and housing, and 16% from federal and non-federal research grants, according to the university’s 2024 financial update.\n\nNearly all the money it takes in goes out. The university’s operating expenses came to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2024: About 52% of that was spent on people’s salaries and benefits, 17% on space, and 19% on supplies and services, according to the university\n\nStaffing makes up a huge portion of the university’s budget: about one-third of Harvard’s expenses last year, or $2.6 billion, went toward wages and salaries for faculty and staff, according to the university.\n\nFollowing Trump’s re-election, the school began taking steps to shore up its finances.\n\nLast month Harvard instituted a temporary hiring freeze it said was “meant to preserve our financial flexibility until we better understand how changes in federal policy will take shape and can assess the scale of their impact.\"\n\nUniversities have flocked to the bond market to raise cash at a near record pace with $12.3 billion in bonds issued in the first three months of the year, making it the biggest single quarter since the start of the financial crisis when $12.4 billion was raised in the first three months of 2009, according to Municipal Market Analytics.\n\nHarvard alone has raised $1.2 billion since the beginning of the year in bonds, according to the data analysis.\n\n“If you don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow, you’re going to want to have enough money set aside to bridge you until things become clearer,\" said Lisa Washburn, managing director of Municipal Market Analytics.\n\nWhat a change in tax-exempt status might mean\n\nIn addition to freezing funds, the Trump administration has sought to turn up the pressure on the university by making plans to rescind the tax-exempt status, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN this week.\n\nChanges to Harvard’s tax status are hard to quantify, experts say.\n\n“It’s very hard to estimate tax rate,\" said Baum from the Urban Institute. “The question is: What would they be taxed on? It’s not like they’re making profits.\"\n\nHarvard could potentially have to pay taxes on property it owns in Boston and Cambridge, and donations to the university would no longer be tax deductible, making them less optimal for wealthy donors’ tax planning strategies. The cost of raising money could also skyrocket.\n\n“They wouldn’t be able to issue tax exempt bonds,\" Washburn of Municipal Market Analytics said. “They’re maintaining a huge program with a huge footprint. If you want to bring in the best professors, the best researchers and you want to have the best labs, that all costs money.\"\n\nThe administration has also threatened to take away Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which allows the university to host international students.\n\nIf Harvard can’t host international students, that could also dip into revenues, experts say.\n\nInternational students often pay full tuition at universities. They make up 27.2% of Harvard’s enrollment in the 2024-25 academic year, university data shows.\n\nWhat’s on the line\n\nFewer funds might mean fewer people receiving financial aid or less research being done, experts say. The university will need to weigh its options.\n\n“They have to figure out whether to give less financial aid, have bigger classes, tell faculty they can do less research. They have to figure out which of the many dimensions of their mission they’re going to cut back on,\" said Gregory Mankiw, an economics professor at Harvard University. “Those are painful choices for any administration. These are terrible choices for society.\"\n\nFederal funding accounted for a large chunk of Harvard’s research money in fiscal year 2024.\n\n“Federal funding is the University’s largest source of support for research, playing a pivotal role in enabling studies that deliver widespread societal benefits,\" the university said in its 2024 report.\n\nThe cuts are already being felt.\n\nHarvard’s School of Public Health, where 46% of the budget comes from federal funding, lost more than $60 million in funding for a tuberculosis research project.\n\nThe school made some layoffs in recent months, saying they were due to cuts in federal funding that hit before the freeze.\n\nAnd Harvard Medical School, which was already in a budget deficit from previous years, is expecting that to get worse “due to tariffs, inflation, rising costs, and anticipated cuts and delays in federal research support,\" according to a spokesperson for the medical school.\n\nAnd the school is bracing for deeper cuts: 40% of its students are international, a spokesperson for the school said.\n\n“The situation now is certainly extraordinary. We still don’t know how big the impact will be on Harvard’s finances,\" he said. “We’ve been around since 1636 so we’ve seen lots of things. I have no doubt Harvard will be a great institution 30 years from now but in the next few years it will be really bumpy.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

    "content": "The MEA's reaction came after Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a prominent Hindu leader in Bangladesh's Dinajpur district, was abducted from his home and brutally beaten to death.\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Saturday condemned the abduction and killing of Hindu leader Bhabesh Chandra Roy in Bangladesh’s Dinajpur district, saying it follows a pattern of “systematic persecution of Hindu minorities. Roy, a resident of Basudebpur village, was abducted from his house and beaten to death by goons on Friday.\n\n“We have noted with distress the abduction and brutal killing of Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a Hindu minority leader in Bangladesh. This killing follows a pattern of systematic persecution of Hindu minorities under the interim government, even as the perpetrators of previous such events roam with impunity,\" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on X.\n\nIn a strongly worded statement, the External Affairs Ministry condemned the incident and reminded the interim government of Bangladesh to “live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities, including Hindus, without inventing excuses or making distinctions.\"\n\nWhat Happened To Bhabesh Chandra Roy?\n\nBhabesh Chandra Roy was the vice-president of the Biral unit of the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad. He was also a prominent leader in the Hindu community of the area. His wife told local media that he was abducted by bike-born assailants after receiving a phone call on Friday.

    "content": "India-US Proposed Trade Pact's Terms Of Reference Include About 19 Chapters: Report\n\nAn Indian official team is visiting Washington next week to iron out differences on certain issues before formally launching negotiations for the proposed India-US bilateral trade agreement (BTA).\n\nThe terms of references (ToRs) finalised by India and the US for the proposed bilateral trade agreement include around 19 chapters covering issues such as goods, services, and customs facilitation, official sources said. To give further impetus to the talks, an Indian official team is visiting Washington next week to iron out differences on certain issues before formally launching negotiations for the proposed India-US bilateral trade agreement (BTA).\n\nIndia’s chief negotiator, Additional Secretary in the Department of Commerce Rajesh Agrawal, will lead the team for the first in-person talks between the two countries.\n\nAgrawal was appointed as the next commerce secretary on April 18. He will assume office from October 1.\n\nThe three-day Indian official team’s talks with the US counterparts in Washington will start from Wednesday (April 23), the official said.\n\nThe visit, which comes within weeks of a high-level US team visiting India, indicates that the talks for the BTA are gaining momentum.\n\nThe visit follows senior official-level talks held between the two countries last month here.\n\nBrendan Lynch, the Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asia, was in India from March 25 to 29 for crucial trade discussions with Indian officials.\n\nThe two sides are keen to utilise the 90-day tariff pause, announced by US President Donald Trump on April 9.\n\nOn April 15, Commerce Secretary Sunil Barthwal had stated that India will try to close the negotiations as quickly as possible with the US.\n\nHe also stated that India has decided to follow the trade liberalisation path with the US.\n\nIndia and the US have been engaged in negotiating a bilateral trade agreement since March. Both sides have targeted to conclude the first phase of the pact by the fall (September-October) of this year, with an aim to more than double the bilateral trade to USD 500 billion by 2030, from about USD 191 billion, currently.\n\nIn a trade pact, two countries either significantly reduce or eliminate customs duties on the maximum number of goods traded between them. They also ease norms to promote trade in services and boost investments.\n\nWhile the US is looking at duty concessions in sectors like certain industrial goods, automobiles (electric vehicles particularly), wines, petrochemical products, dairy, and agriculture items such as apples, tree nuts, and alfalfa hay; India may look at duty cuts for labour-intensive sectors like apparels, textiles, gems and jewellery, leather, plastics, chemicals, oil seeds, shrimp, and horticulture products.\n\nFrom 2021-22 to 2024-25, the US was India’s largest trading partner.\n\nThe US accounts for about 18 per cent of India’s total goods exports, 6.22 per cent in imports, and 10.73 per cent in bilateral trade.\n\nWith America, India had a trade surplus (the difference between imports and exports) of $41.18 billion in goods in 2024-25.

The US has maintained a ‘Level 3: Reconsider Travel’ alert for the country.\n\nHowever, the US Department of State has issued a ‘Level 4: Do Not Travel’ alert for Chittagong Hill Tracts due to communal violence, crime, terrorism, kidnapping, and other security risks.\n\n“Since summer 2024, civil unrest and violent clashes have largely subsided with the formation of the Interim Government. Occasional protests continue with potential for violent clashes,\" the advisory read. “US citizens are reminded to avoid all gatherings, even peaceful ones, since they could turn violent with little or no warning.\"\n\nThe advisory also warned of risks of terrorist violence, including terrorist and other activity in Bangladesh. It warned US citizens of muggings, burglaries, assaults, and illegal drug trafficking in Bangladesh’s major cities.\n\nUS government employees working in Bangladesh have been prohibited from non-essential travel within Dhaka outside of the diplomatic enclave. They are also required to obtain special authorisation to travel outside of Dhaka.\n\n“The US government may have limited ability to provide emergency services to US citizens in Bangladesh, particularly outside of Dhaka, due to these travel restrictions, a lack of infrastructure, and limited host government emergency response resources,\" said the Department of State.\n\nSocial unrest intensified in Bangladesh after the fall of Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League-led government in August 2024, after students protested against her controversial quota bill for government jobs. Islamist attacks on minorities, particularly Hindus, has been on the rise, prompting concerns from neighbouring India as well as the US.\n\nShortly before the US presidential elections, current President Donald Trump condemned the “barbaric violence against Hindus, Christians and other minorities\" by mobs in Bangladesh. He vowed to protect Hindu Americans and strengthen the relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nIndia has time and again raised concerns about the atrocities against Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh. Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi raised the issue of the safety and security of minorities in Bangladesh, including Hindus, during his meeting with Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, held on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC Summit in Bangkok.\n\nMoreover, widespread anti-Israel protests erupted in Bangladesh last week as thousands of people gathered in Dhaka, condemning Israel’s Gaza military offensive and calling for a boycott of Israeli-affiliated products. The protests, which turned violent in some areas, targeted well-known international brands such as Bata, KFC, and Pizza Hut.\n\nThe angry crowds targeted businesses perceived to have ties with Israel, resulting in property damage and disruptions to daily life. Bottles of soft drinks perceived to be Israeli-affiliated were smashed in a KFC restaurant in Mirboxtula, and police had to be deployed in the area.\n\nLocation :\n\nWashington D.C., United States of America (USA)",

India has time and again raised concerns about the atrocities against Hindus and other minorities in Bangladesh.\n\nWho Was Bhabesh Chandra Roy?\n\nBhabesh Chandra Roy was the vice-president of the Biral unit of the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad. He was also a prominent leader in the Hindu community of the area.\n\nBhabesh’s wife, Shantana Roy, told The Daily Star that he was at home in the afternoon when he received a phone call around 4:30 pm, which was made by the perpetrators to confirm his presence at home. Around half an hour later, four men arrived on bikes and allegedly abducted Bhabesh from the premises.\n\nWitnesses saw him being taken to Narabari village, where he was brutally beaten to death. The attackers reportedly sent his unconscious body back to his home in a van. Family members, with the help of locals, rushed Bhabesh to a health complex, from where he was transferred to Dinajpur Medical College Hospital, where on-duty doctors declared him dead upon arrival.\n\nCongress Condemns Attacks On Bangladeshi Hindus\n\nTaking to X, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh wrote, “The Indian National Congress strongly condemns the brutal killing of Shri Bhabesh Chandra Roy, a prominent leader of the Hindu community in Dinajpur, Bangladesh. The abduction and assault leading to his tragic death is a chilling reminder of the growing sense of insecurity among religious minorities in the region.\"\n\n“This is not an isolated incident. Over the past months, there have been repeated and deeply disturbing instances of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh, from desecration of Hindu temples to targeted attack on the homes and businesses of minorities. This pattern of intimidation and brutality cannot be ignored,\" he added.\n\nThe Congress urged the Indian government to take up the matter with the highest urgency and prevail upon the interim government in Bangladesh to ensure a swift and transparent investigation and bring the culprits to justice.\n\nThe incident took place on the same day India rejected Bangladesh’s statement on the violence in West Bengal during protests over the amended Waqf Bill, advising its eastern neighbour to focus on protecting minorities within its own borders. The Ministry of External Affairs said Bangladesh should stop making “unwarranted comments and indulging in virtue signalling\", and safeguard the rights of minorities there.\n\nLast month, a report by the Dhaka-based human rights organisation Ain O Salish Kendra (AsK) revealed a total of 147 incidents involving the vandalism of homes, temples, and business establishments belonging to the Hindu community across Bangladesh.\n\nLocation :\n\nDhaka, Bangladesh",

Those were the first talks at such a high level between the foes since US President Donald Trump abandoned a landmark nuclear accord in 2018.\n\nWestern countries including the United States have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons — an allegation Tehran has consistently denied, insisting that its programme is for peaceful civilian purposes.\n\nTehran and Washington have had no diplomatic relations since shortly after Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution.\n\nFollowing his return to office in January, Trump revived his “maximum pressure\" campaign of sanctions against Iran.\n\nIn March he sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urging renewed nuclear talks while warning of military action if diplomacy fails.\n\n“I’m not in a rush\" to use the military option, Trump said on Thursday. “I think Iran wants to talk.\"\n\nOn Friday Araghchi said Iran “observed a degree of seriousness\" on the US side during the first round but questioned their intentions.\n\n“Although we have serious doubts about the intentions and motivations of the American side, in any case we will participate in tomorrow’s (Saturday) negotiations,\" he said at a press conference in Moscow.\n\n– ‘Crucial stage’ –\n\nIn an interview published Wednesday by French newspaper Le Monde, the United Nations nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said Iran was “not far\" from possessing a nuclear bomb.\n\nDuring Trump’s first term, Washington withdrew from the 2015 accord between Tehran and world powers which offered Iran relief from international sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.\n\nTehran complied with the agreement for a year after Trump’s pullout before scaling back its compliance.\n\nAraghchi was a negotiator of the 2015 deal. His counterpart in Rome, Witkoff, is a real estate magnate Trump has also tasked with talks on Ukraine.\n\nIran currently enriches uranium up to 60 percent, far above the 3.67 limit in the deal but still below the 90 percent threshold required for weapons-grade material.\n\nOn Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio urged European countries to decide on whether to trigger the “snapback\" mechanism under the 2015 agreement, which would automatically reinstate UN sanctions on Iran over its non-compliance.\n\nThe option to trigger the mechanism expires in October this year.\n\nIran has previously warned it could withdraw from the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty if the mechanism were triggered.\n\nGrossi, who held talks with Iranian officials during a visit to Tehran this week, said the US and Iran were “at a very crucial stage\" in the talks and “don’t have much time\" to secure a deal.\n\n– ‘Non-negotiable’ –\n\nIranian officials have insisted that the talks only focus on its nuclear programme and lifting of sanctions.\n\nAraghchi said a deal with the US was “likely\" if Washington refrained from “making unreasonable and unrealistic demands,\" without elaborating.\n\nAnalysts had said the US would push to include discussions over Iran’s ballistic missile programme as well as Tehran’s support for militants in the Middle East.\n\nAraghchi said Iran’s right to enrich uranium was “non-negotiable\", after Witkoff called for its complete halt. Witkoff had previously demanded only that Iran return to the ceiling set by the 2015 deal.\n\nOn Tuesday, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the country’s military capabilities were off limits in the discussions.\n\nIran’s regional influence and its missile capabilities were among its “red lines\" in the talks, the official IRNA news agency reported.\n\nOn Friday US ally Israel affirmed its unwavering commitment to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, saying it had a “clear course of action\" to prevent this.\n\nKhamenei on Tuesday said Iranians should not pin hopes on progress in the negotiations which “may or may not yield results.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by News18 staff and is published from a syndicated news agency feed - AFP)\n\nLocation :\n\nRome, Italy",

It also criticises former US President Joe Biden, US health official Anthony Fauci and the World Health Organisation.\n\n“The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2 publication — which was used repeatedly by public health officials and the media to discredit the lab leak theory — was prompted by Dr Fauci to push the preferred narrative that COVID-19 originated naturally,\" reads the website.\n\nHitting out at China, the website Lab Leaks mentions that the researchers of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) showed COVID-like symptoms in the fall of 2019, months before COVID-19 was discovered at the wet market.\n\nIt also says that the “virus possesses a biological characteristic that is not found in nature\".\n\nNot only this, but the website criticises the steps like social distancing, mask mandates and lockdowns.\n\nEarlier in January, when Trump assumed office, a CIA spokesperson had said that the CIA has assessed that the COVID-19 pandemic is more likely to have emerged from a lab than from nature.\n\nThe website terms WHO’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic as “an abject failure\" for caving to “pressure from the Chinese Communist Party and placing China’s political interests ahead of its international duties.\"\n\nOn making masks compulsory, the website notes, “There was no conclusive evidence that masks effectively protected Americans from COVID-19. Public health officials flip-flopped on the efficacy of masks without providing Americans scientific data — causing a massive uptick in public distrust.\"\n\nChina’s Reaction To US’ Claims\n\nReacting to the claims made by the website, China said that it supports and has taken part in research to find COVID-19’s origin. It also accused them of politicising the issue, adding that there was no credibility to claims that a laboratory leak likely caused the pandemic.\n\nLocation :\n\nWashington D.C., United States of America (USA)",

    "content": "With decades of experience in global markets, WhiteOak Capital’s Prashant Khemka looked back on his own journey and shared some practical advice for both new and experienced investors trying to make sense of today’s unpredictable market.\n\nBy Surabhi Upadhyay\n\nInvesting in the stock market can be a great way to build wealth, but it also comes with risks. In a candid conversation about the dos and don’ts of investing, Prashant Khemka, the Founder of WhiteOak Capital Management, shared the top three mistakes investors often make—sometimes unknowingly.\n\nThese are the three common mistakes:\n\n1. Trying to time the market:\n\nKhemka believes that trying to predict when to enter or exit the market is the biggest mistake investors make. People often react to headlines or global events by quickly selling their stocks or staying out of the market. But this strategy rarely works.\n\n“You'd be fortunate to get it 50% of the time right,” he said, adding that emotional decisions based on fear or speculation usually led to poor results. He’s proud to say this is one mistake he’s personally avoided throughout his career.\n\n2. Using borrowed money to invest:\n\nThe second mistake Khemka warns against is using leverage—borrowing money to invest in the stock market. When people don’t have enough money but want to earn high returns quickly, they are tempted to take loans and buy stocks.\n\n“That’s a mistake I’ve made,” he admitted. While it might seem like a smart move when interest rates are low and stock returns are high, Khemka says this approach can backfire badly, especially when markets fall.\n\nAlso Read: This $2 trillion global fund is 'max overweight' on India\n\n3. Putting all your money in just one or two stocks\n\nKhemka’s third warning is about over-concentration. He shared an example of someone who invested all their money in biotech stocks simply because they liked the sector, even though they had no expertise in it. “That’s like buying a lottery,” he said.\n\nKhemka advises against putting too much faith in one theme or sector, no matter how promising it looks. Diversifying across different companies and industries helps reduce risk.\n\nKhemka believes the best way to invest is to stay disciplined: don’t try to time the market, avoid borrowing to invest, and spread your money across different types of companies.\n\nAlso Read: Manishi Raychaudhuri says market correction not done yet, brace for another dip\n\nFor the entire interview, watch the accompanying video\n\n(Edited by : Shweta Mungre )\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed their inclusion in the international register as a global recognition of India’s “timeless wisdom and rich culture.”\n\n“The Gita and Natyashastra have nurtured civilisation, and consciousness for centuries. Their insights continue to inspire the world,” he wrote on ‘X’.\n\nLaunched in 1992, ‘Memory of the World Register’ is a collection of manuscripts, oral traditions, audio-visual materials and archives of universal value. The project aims to safeguard the documentary heritage of humanity. The Executive Board of UNESCO adds new inscriptions to the register after evaluating them by an independent international advisory committee.\n\n‘Memory of the World Register’ 2025\n\nThe Shrimad Bhagavad Gita is a part of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. It contains 700 verses in 18 chapters and takes the form of a dialogue between Lord Krishna and Arjuna. “Due to its philosophical breadth and depth, the Gita has been read for centuries across the globe and translated into many languages,” noted UNESCO on its website.\n\nComposed between the 2nd Century BC & 2nd Century CE, the Natyashastra preserves India’s ancient performing arts. The Natyashastra established a comprehensive set of rules that define drama, performance, aesthetic experience, emotion & music.\n\nWith the addition of the Gita and the Natyashastra, 14 Indian manuscripts are now part of the UNESCO register. The Saiva Manuscript in Pondicherry (2005), Rigveda (2007), Tarikh-e-Khandan-e-Timuriyah (2011) and Gilgit Manuscripts (2017) are some of India’s contributions to the global register.\n\nApart from the two Indian manuscripts, 72 inscriptions have been added to the register this year, taking the overall total to 570.\n\nSome notable additions include Egypt’s Itḥaf Al-Mahbub, which documents the Arab world’s contributions to astronomy.

Heavy traffic congestion could be seen following the closure of the bridge, as it was an important route for commuters.\n\nBaba Bhide Bridge connects Sinhagad Road with Kothrud and Shivajinagar and Nagar Road to central Pune.\n\nThe Metro authorities have advised the public to use Z-Bridge, Lakdi Pool and Bal Gandharva Bridge as alternative routes to commute in the Mutha riverside areas.\n\nDuring the construction period, only riverside roads will be accessible to the public because authorities will temporarily restrict access to the Bhide Bridge.\n\nThe Deccan Gymkhana-Narayan Peth area was connected through the Baba Bhide Bridge in 1996. The bridge was named after Babarao Bhide, a lawyer and social reformer.\n\nThis bridge has served as an essential pathway primarily for pedestrians, as Khadakwasla Dam releases water during the monsoon season.\n\nThe expansion of Pune Metro continues with the construction of two footbridges for pedestrian connectivity. A bridge connecting Shaniwar Peth to the Bal Gandharva Metro station has reached its final phases. The second overbridge, to be built above the Bhide Bridge, will connect Narayan Peth and Deccan Gymkhana Metro station.\n\nAccording to Metro authorities, the opening of the pedestrian bridge connecting the Bal Gandharva Metro Station will reduce traffic congestion in the area.\n\nThe authorities are likely to issue traffic advisories on the Bhide Bridge closure in the coming days.

    "content": "RBI to remain 'agile & proactive' in policy action amid evolving global situation: Guv Malhotra\n\nObserving that the Indian economy and the financial markets have demonstrated remarkable resilience, Malhotra cautioned that \"they are not immune to the vagaries of an uncertain and volatile global environment.\"\n\nBy PTI\n\nAmid the ongoing tariff war, Reserve Bank Governor (RBI) Sanjay Malhotra has said that the central bank will continuously monitor the rapidly evolving global situation and remain 'agile and proactive' in its policy actions.\n\nObserving that the Indian economy and the financial markets have demonstrated remarkable resilience, Malhotra cautioned that \"they are not immune to the vagaries of an uncertain and volatile global environment.\"\n\n\"In view of the rapidly evolving situation, especially on the global front, we are continuously monitoring and assessing the economic outlook. We will be agile and proactive in our actions on the policy front, as always,\" he said, while addressing the 24th FIMMDA-PDAI Annual Conference in Bali on Friday.\n\nHe said the growth-inflation balance has improved significantly, and there has been a decisive improvement in headline inflation, which is projected to remain aligned with the target of 4% in FY26. Global uncertainties and weather disturbances, however, pose risks to the inflation outlook.\n\nAlso Read: RBI Governor Malhotra warns of dwindling money market liquidity\n\n\"Even though we have projected a somewhat lower real GDP growth for FY26 at 6.5 per cent, India is still the fastest-growing economy. Yet, it is much below what we aspire to. We have reduced repo rates twice and provided sufficient liquidity,\" he said.\n\nOn the Indian financial markets, the Governor said all market segments, including FX, G-sec and Money Markets, have largely remained stable. While the rupee came under a bit of pressure a few months ago, it has fared better thereafter and regained some lost ground, he noted.\n\nEquity markets experienced a significant correction, as capital outflows accelerated, a trend seen in most emerging markets. The government securities market has, however, remained rock-steady throughout the year. The gross market borrowings of the central and state governments, totalling Rs 24.7 lakh crore in FY 2024-25, sailed through smoothly, he said.\n\nThe cost of borrowing for the central government came down by 28 basis points to 6.96% in FY25, from 7.24% in FY24. The secondary market in G-secs continued to be deep and active, partly aided by India's inclusion in global bond indices, he added.\n\nAlso Read: RBI launches quarterly services and infrastructure outlook survey\n\nIn India, Malhotra said markets have evolved within a regulated framework, adapting to changing regulatory philosophies and approaches. He also emphasised that the foreign exchange markets are reasonably liquid with narrow bid-ask spreads, and there is growing transparency in this market.\n\nIn January 2020, banks were permitted to deal in FX beyond onshore market hours. While volumes are not significant, banks are transacting both prior to and post onshore market hours. Such trading, however, is largely confined to the period immediately before and after domestic FX market hours, he noted.\n\n\"Fair treatment of customers and transparency in forex pricing for the smaller and less sophisticated customers continues to engage our attention. Much more can be and needs to be done here. Divergence in pricing in FX markets for the small and large customers are far wider than what can be justified by operational considerations,\" he said.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has recently announced that access to FX Retail will also be provided through the Bharat Connect platform. In the first phase, a pilot to facilitate the purchase of US dollars by individuals is planned. Subsequently, its scope will be expanded based on the experience gained.\n\n\"We also continue to see banking channels being used for activities on unauthorised FX trading platforms. This calls for greater vigilance and stronger efforts by banks to create awareness among their customers about the perils of using such platforms,\" he said.\n\nAlso Read: RBI amasses $97 billion in gold as central banks fuel global buying spree\n\nThe Reserve Bank has been regularly updating the Alert List of unauthorised forex trading platforms and conducting awareness campaigns to educate users.\n\n\"Today, financial markets stand at the cusp of transformation between global and domestic headwinds, unprecedented opportunities and growing public expectations. When transformations such as these take place, there are many moving parts which need to come together like the pieces of a jigsaw and many stakeholders who have critical roles to play,\" Malhotra said.\n\nHe stressed that as India forges ahead to take its rightful place in the emerging global order, financial markets have a crucial role to play. Financial markets will need to facilitate efficient and cost-effective funding for realising the aspirations of the country, he said.\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

    "content": "The film will be a stand-alone feature set about five years after the events of Star Wars: Episode IX—The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nBy CNBCTV18.com\n\nRyan Gosling is set to headline Star Wars: Starfighter, a new standalone entry in the iconic franchise, directed by Deadpool & Wolverine fame Shawn Levy. Announced at the Star Wars Celebration in Tokyo, the film is slated for release in May 2027. Set five years after The Rise of Skywalker, it introduces fresh characters and explores a previously unseen timeline.\n\nThe Star Wars film franchise will have a new face! Lucasfilm has confirmed that Ryan Gosling will star in Star Wars: Starfighter.\n\nThe news came during the Star Wars Celebration event in Tokyo. At the event, both Levy and Gosling went on stage to tease the highly anticipated project.\n\nThe film will be a stand-alone feature set about five years after the events of Star Wars: Episode IX—The Rise of Skywalker. It will not follow the familiar Skywalker storyline but will rather introduce a fresh narrative and original characters.\n\nA Variety report quoted Levy as saying that the film will not be a prequel or a sequel. It will be a new adventure set in a period the franchise has not explored yet. He promised a bold direction for the saga.\n\nAccording to reports, Gosling's great affection for Star Wars was clear during the occasion, with a childhood photo of him with the Star Wars bedsheets on display. When the actor saw the photo, he realised that he had been dreaming about the franchise before seeing the film. He claimed it framed his perception of what a movie was.\n\nHe further added that the Force is mysterious, but standing on stage at the Tokyo celebration, he feels like the Force is the fans.\n\nJonathan Tropper, who previously worked on The Adam Project and Your Friends & Neighbours, wrote the script for the film. Tropper has been a long-time collaborator with Levy, which has generated high hopes among fans.\n\nLucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy and chief creative officer Dave Filoni confirmed that the movie is looking to begin production later this year. The theatrical release is planned for May 28, 2027, the reports stated.\n\nGosling, coming off his Oscar-nominated turn as Ken in Barbie, enters the Star Wars franchise in what is an uncommon franchise venture for the Canadian star. A performer known for award-winning roles in La La Land and The Notebook, Gosling's arrival in the galaxy far, far away has generated great excitement.\n\nLevy's directing credit on Deadpool & Wolverine, which earned $1.3 billion worldwide in 2024, only adds to the anticipation for Starfighter, the report added.\n\nReportedly, before Starfighter hits cinemas, the franchise will return to the big screen with The Mandalorian and Grogu on May 22, 2026. It is a theatrical spin-off of the Disney+ series.\n\nAdditionally, they have announced a new animated series, Maul: Shadow Lord, which will focus on the villain from The Phantom Menace, which is set fora 2026 release too.\n\nGosling, as per the reports, said all the team can hope for is for the fans to support them.\n\n(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani )\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

The development comes amid an investigation by SEBI against company co-founders, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, who are also the promoters of Gensol Engineering.\n\nBluSmart users reported being unable to book rides for specific travel times or dates through the company’s mobile app starting from Wednesday.

The promoters are under probe for allegedly routing the funds to related entities and using them for unrelated expenses. The alleged fund misuse amounts to ₹262 crore, which was part of the loan given to Gensol for purchasing EVs. This loan was provided by the state-run Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) and Power Finance Corporation (PFC).\n\nAs a result, SEBI has barred the founders from holding key positions in the company, casting a shadow on the company’s future.\n\n(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani )\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

The addition of Epic Universe brings the total number of parks at the Florida resort to four, including Universal Studios.\n\nThe opening also raises the stakes in Universal's competition with crosstown rival Walt Disney World for a greater share of Orlando's annual influx of 74 million tourists.\n\nUniversal officials also describe Epic Universe as the company's most technologically advanced theme park. For example, it uses a facial recognition system for ride express lines.\n\nAlso Read: Disney Floating Park: Here's what to expect on your next adventure\n\nUniversal's owner, Comcast NBCUniversal, also announced plans this month for its first Universal-branded theme park and resort in Europe, at a location north of London. A year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas should open later this year and a family-oriented theme park is slated to open next year in a Dallas suburb.\n\nEpic Universe is making its big bang, with single-day tickets starting at $139 for adults and increasing to $199 during peak periods, just as the Trump administration stirs up economic uncertainty.\n\nU.S. tariff announcements threaten to limit the desire of some Americans to spend on vacations. And the rough treatment that some U.S. visitors have experienced on arrival, as well as a boycott of the United States by some Canadians, are raising fears that international tourists will stay away.\n\nTax receipts show Orlando's tourist economy was booming last year, with Orange County collecting a record $359 million in tourist taxes.\n\nHere's a look at Epic Universe's different sections.\n\nCelestial Park is the hub in the spoke-like design of Epic Universe, connecting the other “worlds.”\n\nThe astronomically-themed section is the only one with original characters not based on pre-existing intellectual property. Centered around a football field-sized water fountain and filled with abundant, colorful flowers, it's an oasis of calm between the sensory overload of the four sections.\n\nThat's not to say excitement can't be found in Celestial Park, which is home to a 133-foot (40.5-meter) high dual launching roller coaster, Stardust Racers, and an enormous carousel.\n\nSuper Nintendo World is the definition of sensory overload, from its bright primary colors that scream “Look at me!” to the loudness of the steel-drum-thumping syncopated calypso music.\n\nIt has two levels — rare for theme parks — and creates a completely immersive experience since nothing outside Super Nintendo World can be seen beyond the towering walls of Peach's Castle and Mt. Beanpole. There is an augmented reality dark ride, a kid-friendly, slow-moving omni-mover ride and a Donkey Kong-themed coaster. Character performers dressed as Mario and Luigi greet members of the crowd in a roped-off area.\n\nDark Universe is a throwback to Frankenstein's monster, Dracula and the Invisible Man movies that launched Universal's career in horror franchises.\n\nVisitors enter through a recreated central European village that has a storyline about vampires inhabiting the ground underneath. There is a dark ride through Frankenstein's castle, a family-friendly coaster based on the werewolf legend and a tavern topped by a windmill with blades engulfed by flames every few minutes.\n\nFrom Fantasy Beasts To Vikings\n\nThis is the third installment of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attractions that turbocharged the Florida resort into a genuine challenger to Disney World's dominance.\n\nThe arched doorways, wrought-iron balconies and cobblestoned streets make visitors feel like they have parachuted into the Fantastic Beasts films set in 1920s Paris. The land's highlight is the Battle at the Ministry's omnidirectional lift ride, whose green-tiled, faux-gold-plated atrium is on a scale reminiscent of New York's Grand Central Terminal.\n\nNext-generation animatronic dragons are the stars in this section, based on the “How to Train Your Dragon” franchise.\n\nAnchored by a lagoon at its center with Viking statues, the Viking-inspired land has a coaster, a boat ride and meet-and-greets with the surprisingly agile dragons, these aren't your father's animatronics.\n\nAlso Read: 84% Indians prefer combining credit card and loyalty rewards for better travel value: American Express\n\n(Edited by : Juviraj Anchil )\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

    "link": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/business/companies/independent-directors-12-risk-factors-governance-failures-company-boards-19591112.htm",
    "content": "The role of an independent director involves significant fiduciary responsibilities, strategic oversight, and personal exposure to both reputational and legal risks. According to Hersh Shah, Chief Executive Officer of IRM India Affiliate, in his Saturday column, independent directors should make well-informed judgments about the integrity and sustainability of an organisation’s governance framework, keeping in mind the various potential risks.\n\nBy Hersh Shah\n\nCorporate governance failures are becoming alarmingly frequent, even in the most well-capitalised and high-profile enterprises. From the misappropriation of funds and promoter-driven conflicts of interest to deliberate financial misstatements and opaque disclosures, instances of misconduct have surfaced across the corporate spectrum — including listed entities and venture-backed start-ups.\n\nIn 2023, several well-funded emerging businesses came under regulatory and investor scrutiny for serious governance lapses, reflecting systemic weaknesses in oversight, internal controls, and board independence.\n\nGlobally, high-profile corporate collapses have reinforced the urgent need for robust checks on executive decision-making and board-level diligence. These failures don’t just undermine investor confidence and destroy value — they expose companies to legal penalties and reputational erosion, and place independent directors at significant personal and professional risk.\n\nWhen governance falters, independent directors are often among the first to face scrutiny. Entrusted with fiduciary duties of care, diligence, and loyalty, they are expected to provide objective oversight and safeguard stakeholder interests. However, as regulatory frameworks evolve and stakeholder expectations rise, directors are increasingly being held liable for lapses they failed to foresee or address.\n\nIf a company’s financial statements are found to be misleading, or if material disclosures were suppressed, independent directors may be held accountable — regardless of their direct involvement. In cases involving fraud, regulatory non-compliance, or wilful negligence, directors may even face civil and criminal liability. In such a high-stakes environment, vigilance is not optional — it is imperative.\n\nThe ability to identify early warning signs and latent risk factors can empower independent directors to take corrective action, demand accountability, or, when necessary, dissociate from a company before reputational or legal exposure becomes irreversible.\n\nHere are the Risk Factors for Independent Directors:\n\nBelow is a practical checklist of 12 distinct risk factors that independent directors should watch for while serving on a company’s board. Each represents a potential red flag that warrants close attention and prompt action.\n\n1. Deficient Risk Culture and Tone at the Top: The organization’s risk culture – essentially how it views and manages risk – is a critical factor. The Institute of Risk Management (IRM) defines “risk culture” as the values, beliefs, knowledge and understanding about risk shared by a group (especially leadership and employees) in an organization . If there’s a disconnect between the company’s stated values and its actual practices (for example, management turning a blind eye to risk limits or ethical standards), that’s a sign of a poor risk culture that can imperil the business. Independent directors should gauge the tone at the top: Do the CEO and executives model ethical, risk-aware behavior, or do they tolerate rule-bending? A culture that condones reckless behavior or silences bad news will inevitably undermine effective governance . Moreover, a healthy risk culture requires that those at the top (promoters, the CEO, and the Chief Risk Officer) have aligned incentives – sufficient skin in the game – so that managing risk is more than just lip service. Directors must assess whether leadership truly “walks the talk” on risk management.\n\n2. Questionable Promoter Integrity and Ethics: If a company’s promoters or founders lack integrity, even the best governance frameworks may fail. Boards should vet controlling shareholders’ backgrounds for any history of fraud or regulatory trouble. The character of those at the top is paramount – warning signs include promoters treating the business as a personal fiefdom, engaging in self-dealing transactions, or evading accountability when issues arise. Even subtle dishonesty or evasiveness from management is cause for concern. Ethical lapses at the top create a tone where minor transgressions can escalate into major frauds and put the entire board in jeopardy.\n\n3. Related-Party Transactions and Fund Diversion: Misuse of company resources via related-party transactions is a common red flag. Independent directors should scrutinize any deals between the company and entities controlled by the promoters or their family. For instance, if the company lends money to a promoter’s private firm or buys services at inflated prices from a related entity, that warrants immediate attention. In recent fiascos, some founders treated investor capital like personal funds – leading to massive value destruction. A pattern of opaque deals that disproportionately benefit insiders is a major warning sign. Directors must dig into such arrangements and demand clear justification. Any transaction that unduly favors an insider without a valid business rationale should be blocked or investigated.\n\n4. Financial Misreporting and Accounting Irregularities: Aggressive accounting or irregular financial reporting is an obvious red flag. Independent directors should watch for practices like revenue being recognized too early, unexplained boosts in earnings, or chronic delays in closing the books. Such tactics can mask problems only temporarily – for example, inflating revenue until the figures depart from reality . Directors should heed auditors’ warnings: repeated audit adjustments, “material weaknesses” in controls, or qualified audit opinions all signal trouble. If management cannot provide straightforward explanations for unusual accounting entries or consistently paints an overly rosy financial picture, the board should press for the truth. Reliable financial reporting is the bedrock of trust in a company.\n\n5. Weak Internal Controls and Risk Management: Many governance failures result from an internal control environment that is weak or easily overridden. If internal audit or compliance functions are understaffed, ignored, or bypassed, issues can fester unchecked . For example, if serious problems flagged by internal auditors go unaddressed, or if there’s no independent risk officer to raise concerns, the board should be worried. Similarly, a lack of basic checks (such as proper segregation of duties in financial processes) creates opportunities for fraud. Independent directors must insist on robust internal controls and get candid reports on their effectiveness. A company that doesn’t actively enforce its controls is essentially flying blind, leaving directors exposed to nasty surprises.\n\n6. Regulatory Non-Compliance and Legal Breaches: A company that habitually flouts laws or regulations is a ticking time bomb. Whether it’s ignoring environmental rules, violating labor laws, or breaching securities regulations, regulatory non-compliance can lead to hefty fines and sanctions — and directors may be on the hook if they fail to ensure compliance. Independent directors should watch for any pattern of legal violations or frequent regulatory penalties. Even what seem like minor infractions can signal a lax compliance culture. If warnings from regulators or internal compliance officers are shrugged off, that is a serious red flag.\n\n7. Board Composition and Dysfunctional Dynamics: The board itself can be a source of risk if it’s not truly independent or effective. If most “independent” directors are beholden to the promoter or lack the expertise to challenge management, the board cannot properly oversee the company. In some corporate failures, outside directors were bystanders who rubber-stamped management’s actions. Warning signs include a domineering chair/CEO who controls the agenda, decisions being made outside of formal meetings, or an audit committee that never challenges reports. If the board is an echo chamber or kept in the dark, independent directors cannot fulfill their role — a dangerous situation for the director as well as the company.\n\n8. Dominant Leadership and Management Override: A domineering CEO or founder who brooks no dissent is a major red flag. When one individual’s influence is so strong that even other executives (like the CFO) are unwilling or unable to contradict them, normal checks and balances break down. For example, a powerful CEO paired with a weak, acquiescent CFO is a recipe for uncontrolled decision-making . Signs of this dynamic include management routinely bypassing approval processes or a culture where employees are afraid to deliver bad news. Independent directors must be vigilant if they sense that all decisions funnel through one person. They should insist on governance guardrails – such as an empowered audit committee, strong internal audit, and regular executive sessions without the CEO – to prevent management override.\n\n9. High Turnover in Key Positions or Advisors: Unusual turnover in senior ranks can signal deeper issues. If a company has churned through several CFOs or compliance heads in short order, or if its external auditor resigns unexpectedly, independent directors should ask tough questions. An auditor’s resignation is often a glaring warning – if an audit firm quits citing concerns about management’s integrity or transparency, serious trouble may be afoot . Likewise, high turnover among other gatekeeper roles (internal audit, legal, compliance) or a wave of departures of top talent suggests a toxic or unstable environment. Such patterns warrant immediate scrutiny to uncover what’s driving people away.\n\n10. Misaligned Incentives and Excessive Risk-Taking: Compensation structures that encourage reckless behavior pose a serious risk. If executive bonuses and stock awards are tied solely to short-term metrics (like quarterly revenue or share price), managers might feel pressured to cut corners to hit those targets. A reward system that only celebrates successes and never penalizes failures can breed excessive risk-taking. Independent directors should ensure that pay plans include balanced metrics – not just growth, but also factors like compliance, safety, and long-term sustainability. If, for example, a CEO gets a huge payout despite the company facing big write-offs or compliance problems, that’s a red flag of misaligned incentives. Alternatively, if the company is witnessing unreasonably high growth, it’s an area of concern too.\n\n11. Lack of Transparency and Poor Information Flow: A lack of open, honest information flow to the board is perilous. If management provides only rosy updates and conceals problems, the board is operating blind. Executives who discourage tough questions or deem certain topics “not for the board” are undermining oversight. Likewise, a culture of silos – where departments don’t share data – can keep directors in the dark. Independent directors should insist on unfiltered access to information, such as regular sessions with auditors without management present to hear any concerns. When transparency is lacking, issues may remain hidden until they explode into a crisis – at which point directors will be asked why they didn’t know.\n\n12. Ignoring Whistleblowers and Early Warnings: How a company handles internal warnings speaks volumes. If credible whistleblower complaints or employee concerns are ignored (or worse, whistleblowers are punished), it signals a dangerous culture. Often, major scandals have early warnings that were disregarded. Independent directors should ensure there are safe channels for raising concerns and that allegations are properly investigated. Regulators have warned that directors who ignore red flags do so at their own peril . Thus, if a director becomes aware of a serious allegation – via a whistleblower tip, audit finding, or media report – they must push for a thorough investigation rather than sweeping it under the rug. Addressing issues promptly can stop a problem in its tracks, whereas dismissing warnings is effectively inviting disaster.\n\nIn summary, the role of an independent director entails significant fiduciary obligations, strategic oversight, and personal exposure to reputational and legal risks. By leveraging the twelve risk factors outlined above as a diagnostic checklist, independent directors can make informed judgments about the integrity and sustainability of an organisation’s governance framework.\n\nProactive identification of governance red flags enables timely intervention — whether by recommending corrective action, demanding greater transparency, or, if necessary, resigning from a deteriorating board environment. In an era defined by regulatory vigilance, stakeholder activism, and heightened liability, a posture of informed scepticism and constructive challenge is no longer optional — it is essential. Such diligence not only fortifies the director’s individual standing but also contributes meaningfully to preserving corporate accountability, ethical stewardship, and long-term enterprise resilience.\n\n—The author, Hersh Shah, is Chief Executive Officer, IRM India Affiliate, the world’s leading professional certifying body for Enterprise Risk Management.

All at once. From ‘Mother Monster’ Lady Gaga to Punk legends Green Day, the show was an absolute testament to the love of music and musicians, along with surprise elements like guitar legend Bryan May and Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nThe weekend blended music, activism, and pop culture like never before, raising the bar for what’s next. As Weekend Two kicks off, I look back at the top 5 moments that grabbed my attention.\n\nLady Gaga’s career-defining performance\n\nLady Gaga delivered a performance that will go down in history as the perfect mix of theatrics, talent and star power. Mother Monster transformed the main stage into a neoclassical opera house for a five-act spectacle titled The Art of Personal Chaos. Blending hits like “Bad Romance”, “Shallow” and “Poker Face” and with new tracks from her album Mayhem, she incorporated elaborate choreography, costume changes, and a collaboration with Gesaffelstein on “Killah.” The internet hailed it as one of Coachella’s best-ever shows, with clips dominating social media.\n\nBenson ‘Freddie’ Boone and Queen tribute\n\nBenson Boone’s Coachella debut was a high-energy spectacle where the 22-year-old pop-R&B singer channelled legend Freddie Mercury with a glam-rock aesthetic and white-and-blue lurex bodysuit. The highlight of his set was a show-stopping cover of Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody,” featuring a surprise appearance by Queen guitarist Brian May, who joined for the iconic guitar solo and stayed to perform “Beautiful Things” with a gospel choir.\n\nGreen Day’s grand debut amid the ‘MAGA agenda’\n\nPunk legends Green Day made an explosive debut kicking off with “American Idiot” tweaking the lyrics from “I’m not a part of a redneck agenda” to “I’m not a part of a MAGA agenda” — a nod to their ongoing political commentary targeting Trump’s administration. From the erstwhile Bush Administration to Trump 2.0, the anthem remains as powerful as ever. Green Day set a rebellious tone, amplified by Billie Joe Armstrong’s tweak in “Jesus of Suburbia” to reference “kids from Palestine,” earning crowd cheers amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. The performance leaned into their punk ethos, with minimal political speeches but pointed lyrical changes.\n\nCharli XCX’s celebration with star guests\n\nCharli XCX’s performance was a high-energy celebration of her album Brat, featuring surprise appearances by Lorde (“Girl, So Confusing”), Billie Eilish (“Guess”), and Troye Sivan (“Talk Talk”). Dubbed “Bratchella,” the set encapsulated her cultural influence, with fans and online audiences buzzing over the collaborative energy and Charli’s declaration of “Lorde Summer 2025.”\n\nBernie Sanders’ surprise appearance with Clairo\n\nIn an unexpected political moment, Senator Bernie Sanders introduced Clairo’s set, urging the crowd to fight for justice and combat climate change. Sanders delivered a three-minute speech urging the largely Gen Z and millennial crowd to fight for justice. He also spoke about economic, social, and racial justice, women’s reproductive rights, healthcare as a human right, and combating climate change, criticising President Donald Trump’s policies, including his claim that climate change is a “hoax.”\n\nAlso Read: Got Guns N' Roses tickets?

    "link": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/world/israel-still-eyeing-a-limited-attack-on-irans-nuclear-facilities-19591135.htm",
    "content": "U.S. and Iranian negotiators are set for a second round of preliminary nuclear talks in Rome on Saturday.\n\nBy Reuters\n\nIsrael has not ruled out an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities in the coming months despite President Donald Trump telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. was for now unwilling to support such a move, according to an Israeli official and two other people familiar with the matter.\n\nIsraeli officials have vowed to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and Netanyahu has insisted that any negotiation with Iran must lead to the complete dismantling of its nuclear program.\n\nU.S. and Iranian negotiators are set for a second round of preliminary nuclear talks in Rome on Saturday.\n\nOver the past months, Israel has proposed to the Trump administration a series of options to attack Iran’s facilities, including some with late spring and summer timelines, the sources said. The plans include a mix of airstrikes and commando operations that vary in severity and could set back Tehran's ability to weaponize its nuclear program by just months or a year or more, the sources said.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Wednesday that Trump told Netanyahu in a White House meeting earlier this month that Washington wanted to prioritize diplomatic talks with Tehran and that he was unwilling to support a strike on the country’s nuclear facilities in the short term.\n\nBut Israeli officials now believe that their military could instead launch a limited strike on Iran that would require less U.S. support. Such an attack would be significantly smaller than those Israel initially proposed.\n\nIt is unclear if or when Israel would move forward with such a strike, especially with talks on a nuclear deal getting started. Such a move would likely alienate Trump and could risk broader U.S. support for Israel.\n\nParts of the plans were previously presented last year to the Biden administration, two former senior Biden administration officials told Reuters. Almost all required significant U.S. support via direct military intervention or intelligence sharing. Israel has also requested that Washington help Israel defend itself should Iran retaliate.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, the U.S. National Security Council referred Reuters to comments Trump made on Thursday, when he told reporters he has not waved Israel off an attack but that he was not \"in a rush\" to support military action against Tehran.\n\n“I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death,” Trump said. “That's my first option. If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran, and I think Iran is wanting to talk.”\n\nThe Israeli prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A senior Israeli official told Reuters that no decision has been made yet on an Iranian strike.\n\nA senior Iranian security official said Tehran was aware of Israeli planning and that an attack would provoke \"a harsh and unwavering response from Iran.\"\n\n\"We have intelligence from reliable sources that Israel is planning a major attack on Iran's nuclear sites. This stems from dissatisfaction with ongoing diplomatic efforts regarding Iran’s nuclear program, and also from Netanyahu’s need for conflict as a means of political survival,\" the official told Reuters.\n\nBIDEN ADMINISTRATION PUSHBACK\n\nNetanyahu received pushback from the Biden administration when he presented an earlier version of the plan. The former senior Biden officials said Netanyahu wanted the U.S. to take the lead on airstrikes but the Biden White House told Israel it did not believe a strike was prudent unless Tehran moved to accelerate its enrichment of nuclear material or expel inspectors from the country.\n\nThe Biden officials also questioned the extent to which Israel’s military could effectively carry out such an attack.\n\nFormer officials and experts have long said that Israel would need significant U.S. military support – and weapons – to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities and stockpiles, some of which are in underground facilities.\n\nWhile the more limited military strike Israel is considering would require less direct assistance - particularly in the form of U.S. bombers dropping bunker-busting munitions that can reach deeply buried facilities - Israel would still need a promise from Washington that it would help Israel defend itself if attacked by Tehran in the aftermath, the sources said.\n\nAny attack would carry risks. Military and nuclear experts say that even with massive firepower, a strike would probably only temporarily set back a program the West says aims to eventually produce a nuclear bomb, although Iran denies it.\n\nIsraeli officials have told Washington in recent weeks that they do not believe U.S. talks with Iran should move forward to the deal-making stage without a guarantee that Tehran will not have the ability to create a nuclear weapon.\n\n\"This can be done by agreement, but only if this agreement is Libyan style: They go in, blow up the installations, dismantle all of the equipment, under American supervision,\" Netanyahu said following his talks with Trump. \"The second possibility is ... that they (Iran) drag out the talks and then there is the military option.\"\n\nFrom Israel's perspective, this may be a good moment for a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.\n\nIran allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been hammered by Israel since the Gaza war began, while the Houthi movement in Yemen has been targeted by U.S. airstrikes. Israel also severely damaged Iran's air defense systems in an exchange of fire in October 2024.\n\nA top Israeli official, speaking with reporters earlier this month, recognized there was some urgency if the goal was to launch a strike before Iran rebuilds its air defenses. But the senior official refused to state any timeline for possible Israeli action and said discussing this would be \"pointless\".\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

Trade analysts are watching closely to see if the film can surpass its previous version’s lifetime collection.\n\nThe highly anticipated Kesari Chapter 2 released in theatres on April 18. The Akshay Kumar-starrer made a moderate opening at the domestic box office with a collection of ₹7.5 crore, as per industry tracker Sacnilk.com. However, the historical drama has failed to even reach ₹10 crore collection at the domestic box office on the second day, on April 19.\n\nAs per Sacnilk data, the sequel of the 2019 film Kesari has garnered only ₹58 lakh on the second day. So far, the movie’s box office collection stands at ₹8.08 crore.\n\nThe Karan Singh Tyagi directorial, which is a historical courtroom drama, received a largely positive response from both the audience and the critics. The trade analysts believe the patriotic tone of the film and good word-of-mouth is likely to aid its box office performance over the weekend.\n\nAs per the reports, unlike its 2019 version, Kesari, the sequel focuses on the legal aftermath of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of April 13, 1919. The film follows the story of Sir C Sankaran Nair, a member of the Viceroy’s Executive Council, who resigned in protest of the massacre. He later sued General Reginald Dyer and the British Crown.\n\nR Madhavan plays Dilreet Gill, Nair's co-counsel, with Ananya Panday in a supporting part. Together, their characters take on the Empire in court and the media. They reveal the truth behind the brutality inflicted on innocent civilians gathered there to peacefully protest against the Rowlatt Act during Baisakhi.\n\nAs per the Sacnilk data, on the opening day, Kesari Chapter 2 registered a modest 12.67% occupancy in the morning shows. The numbers improved steadily, with the occupancy rate for evening shows hitting 19.76%. By the end of day 1, the occupancy of the film hit 27.80%.\n\nAccording to reports, the film saw a good footfall in Chennai, where Hindi occupancy peaked at 51.25%. The next highest occupancy was reported in Bengaluru at 30.5%. The Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) saw an occupancy rate of 25%, Hyderabad at 24.75%, and Lucknow at 22%.\n\nWith positive early reviews and increasing buzz on social media, Kesari Chapter 2 is expected to see an uptick in footfalls over the weekend, according to reports.\n\nAlthough the movie avoided a box office clash with Sanjay Dutt's Bhootnii due to the film’s rescheduled release on May 1, it now competes with Sunny Deol and Randeep Hooda's Jaat.\n\n(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani )\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

The group asked local organisers to initiate their own protests against the Trump administration’s “abuse of executive power, the SAVE Act and the potential misuse of the Insurrection Act of 1807.”\n\nBy CNBCTV18.com\n\nThousands of people across the United States are set to protest against President Donald Trump on April 19. Organised by the 50501 Movement, around 400 anti-Trump demonstrations will take place on Saturday, Axios reported. The demonstrations will take place in major cities like Chicago, Houston and Portland, among others.\n\nThe 50501 Movement, which stands for 50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement, has declared April 19 as a ‘Day of Action’. The activist group asked local organisers to initiate their own protests against the Trump administration’s “abuse of executive power, the SAVE Act and the potential misuse of the Insurrection Act of 1807.”\n\nThe demonstrations organised by the grassroots movement follow similar protests during the ‘Hands Off’ rally on April 9. The rally was the largest single-day protest organised during Trump’s second term.\n\nThe 50501 Movement is also calling for demonstrations against Elon Musk and the cuts put in place by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In addition, ‘Tesla Takedown’ events are planned in cities like Portland, Oregon, the USA Today reported.\n\n50501 Movement: All you need to know\n\nInitially started on Reddit, 50501 Movement is a grassroots activist network that is built on decentralised mobilisation. It first came into prominence on February 5, with a nationwide protest days after Trump’s inauguration. Since then, the group has organised several peaceful anti-Trump demonstrations, including the ‘Hands Off’ rally on April 9. Millions across the country took to the streets during the ‘Hands Off ' protest.\n\nAs per 50501 Movement’s website, the organisation aims to show “that the American working class will not sit idly by as plutocrats rip apart their democratic institutions and civil liberties while undermining the rule of law.”\n\nAccording to the Movement’s Substack page, the April 19 event will lend support to Americans who have lost their jobs, lost access to food (food stamps, pantries struggling to remain open), impacted by the stock market crashing due to tariff announcements and trying to meet increases in the cost of living.\n\nApart from protests, the events will include environmental clean-ups and donation drives. The 50501 Movement aims to create a ‘social support web’ for Americans as Donald Trump’s policies affect the lives of common people, especially those in marginalised communities.\n\nThe date of April 19 was chosen by the organisers in order to commemorate the anniversary of the Battle of Lexington and Concord, an event which took place during the American Revolutionary War in 1775, as “a historic reminder of resistance to tyranny.”\n\nThe Trump administration has come under sharp criticism for its policies over the last few months, including mass layoffs by DOGE at federal agencies, attempts to deport legal residents, reciprocal tariffs on most nations, including American allies and funding freezes for private universities for refusing to submit to increased oversight, the Washington Post reported.\n\n(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani )\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

The incident occurred on Thursday evening (local time) in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nThe victim has been identified as Harsimrat Randhawa, a student of Mohawk College, according to Hamilton Police.\n\nRandhawa was hit by a stray bullet fired by a car occupant while she was waiting at a bus stop on her way to work.\n\nHamilton Police verified that she was not participating in any fighting and was only an ‘innocent bystander’ caught in the crossfire.\n\n“Hamilton Police are investigating after an innocent bystander was tragically killed by a stray bullet while standing at a bus stop on Upper James in #HamOnt,” read a post on X from the official account of Hamilton Police.\n\nAccording to a CBC news report, the shooting incident happened near Upper James Street and South Bend Road around 7.30 pm.

Other layoffs and policies have been subjected to stop-and-go litigation and court orders.\n\nBy AP\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's attempt to fire nearly everyone at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was paused on Friday by a federal judge, who said she was “deeply concerned” about the plan and issued an order warning that administration officials appeared to be “thumbing their nose” at the courts.\n\nThe decision leaves in limbo a bureau created after the Great Recession to safeguard against fraud, abuse and deceptive practices. Trump administration officials argue that it has overstepped its authority and should have a more limited mission.\n\nOn Thursday, the administration officials moved to fire roughly 1,500 people, leaving around 200 employees, through a reduction in force that would dramatically downsize the bureau.\n\nAlso Read: Trump admin studying option to fire Fed chief Powell\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she was worried the layoffs would violate earlier court decisions. In her written order, she said the administration was poised to “decimate the agency and render it unable to comply with its statutory duties.” If the plan were allowed to proceed, “there will be no agency standing” by the time she renders a decision on an earlier lawsuit filed by an employee union that wants to preserve the bureau.\n\nHer harsh language is the latest example of friction between the executive and judicial branches, which has increased as Trump aggressively flexes his presidential power.\n\n“There is reason to believe,” Jackson wrote, that administration officials “are thumbing their nose\" at judges who have ruled against them.\n\nShe scheduled a hearing on April 28 to hear testimony from officials who worked on the reduction in force, or RIF.\n\n“I’m willing to resolve it quickly, but I’m not going to let this RIF go forward until I have,” she said during a hearing on Friday.\n\nAlso Read: Trump's attack on Powell threaten the Fed's independence--why it matters\n\nTrump's plans have often faced legal hurdles as he works to reshape the federal government, saying it’s rife with fraud, waste and abuse. Other layoffs and policies have been subjected to stop-and-go litigation and court orders.\n\nThe CFPB has long frustrated businesses with its oversight and investigations, and Trump adviser Elon Musk made it a top target of his Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nMark Paoletta, the CFPB's chief legal officer, wrote in a court declaration that \"the bureau's activities have pushed well beyond the limits of the law,\" including what he described as “intrusive and wasteful fishing expeditions.”\n\nHe said officials have spent weeks developing “a much more limited vision for enforcement and supervision activities” with a “smaller, more efficient operation.”\n\nSome of the CFPB's responsibilities are required by law, but would have only one person assigned to them under the Trump administration's plan.\n\nThe enforcement division is slated to be cut from 248 to 50 employees. The supervision division faces an even deeper reduction, from 487 to 50, plus a relocation from Washington to the Southeastern region.\n\nBefore Friday’s hearing, attorneys for the National Treasury Employees Union filed a sworn statement from a CFPB employee identified only by the pseudonym Alex Doe. The employee said Gavin Kliger, a member of DOGE, was managing the agency’s RIF team charged with sending layoff notices.\n\n“He kept the team up for 36 hours straight to ensure that the notices would go out yesterday,” the employee said. “Gavin was screaming at people he did not believe were working fast enough to ensure they could go out on this compressed timeline, calling them incompetent.”\n\nThe bureau’s chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, told the judge that he believes Kliger is an Office of Personnel Management employee detailed to the CFPB and doesn’t work directly for DOGE.\n\nJackson said she will require Kliger to attend and possibly testify at the April 28 hearing. She said she wants to know why he was there “and what we was doing.”\n\n“We’re not going to decide what happened until we know what happened,” Jackson said.\n\nAlso Read: Trump says Powell will be out fast if the President wants it\n\nThe pseudonymous employee said team members raised concerns that the bureau had to conduct a “particularized assessment” before it could implement an RIF. Paoletta told them to ignore those concerns and move forward with mass firings, adding that “leadership would assume the risk,” the employee stated.\n\nWhite House officials did not immediately respond to questions about the judge's decision or the employee's court declaration.\n\nAn OPM spokesperson said Kliger didn’t manage the CFPB reduction in force and dismissed the allegation as part of an effort to diminish DOGE’s ability to achieve its mission. The spokesperson spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

    "content": "White House promotes lab leak theory of COVID-19 origins on revamped website; targets Biden, Fauci\n\nThe Covid.gov website accused Biden and Fauci for advancing what it termed the \"preferred narrative that Covid-19 originated naturally.”\n\nBy CNBCTV18.com\n\nThe White House has doubled down on its contentious theory that the coronavirus originated from a lab leak in China in its newly unveiled COVID-19 website. Under the new administration, the White House has launched a revamped website about COVID-19 that promotes the ‘lab leak’ theory and also criticises former US President Joe Biden, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Anthony Fauci, the former top US health official.\n\nThe Covid.gov website, unveiled on Friday, was earlier focused on disseminating vaccine and testing information. It now includes President Donald Trump’s full-length image and what it claims are the ‘true origins’ of the pandemic. More than one million have died of coronavirus and related illnesses in the United States since 2020.\n\nAccording to AFP, the White House ’s new coronavirus website presents five bullet points on the lab leak theory. The site stated that Wuhan, which is where the first known coronavirus case was detected, contains China's ‘foremost SARS research lab,’ which has been conducting ‘inadequate biosafety levels’ for a long time.\n\n“By nearly all measures of science, if there were evidence of a natural origin, it would have already surfaced. But it hasn't,” the website mentioned.\n\nThe website was also critical of measures enacted by the Biden administration during the pandemic, such as social distancing, mask mandates and lockdowns. It accused Biden and Fauci for advancing what it termed the “preferred narrative that Covid-19 originated naturally.”\n\nThe revamped portal, under the ‘COVID-19 misinformation’ section, accused public health officials under the Biden administration of not stating the benefits of ‘alternative treatments’ and collaborating with social media companies to censor dissenting views, particularly those by conservatives, about the pandemic.\n\nThis charge has frequently been levied by Trump supporters against the Biden administration.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, Fauci, Biden and WHO did not provide any immediate comments on the website or the accusations.\n\nAs for China, the country has been critical of the lab leak theory since it first originated. In January, after the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) changed its official stance to state that it was ‘more likely’ that the coronavirus originated from a leak at a Chinese lab rather than natural transmission from animals, Beijing said that the accusations had no credibility.\n\nThe Chinese government had accused the US of politicising the origins of the coronavirus.\n\nThe revamped website comes amid two big changes in US policy- the escalating trade war with China and the appointment of known vaccine sceptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr as the health secretary. Kennedy and Trump have also initiated widespread job cuts in the US health department. According to reports, 10,000 people could be laid off from the agency.\n\n(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani )\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

    "content": "If you want to enjoy the crispy, spicy and tangy puchkas at home here is a simple recipe to make this traditional Kolkata-style snack at home.\n\nBy CNBCTV18.com\n\nPani Puri is one of the most famous Indian street snacks, which consists of crispy puris stuffed with a delectable spiced potato filling and flavoured with spicy, tangy pani (water). In Kolkata, panipuri is popularly known as puchka, and over the years, it has remained one of the most loved items among street food lovers.\n\nThe capital city of West Bengal is undoubtedly a paradise for food lovers, and its street food culture has a rich tradition. Evolved over the years, Kolkata’s street food culture is a blend of Mughlai, British and Bengali culinary traditions. Kolkata attracts food lovers from across the country for its wide variety of cuisines, especially street food, at an affordable price. And no street food exploration in the city of joy is complete without puchkas.\n\nIf you want to enjoy crispy, spicy, and tangy puchkas at home, follow this step-by-step recipe for this traditional Kolkata-style snack.\n\nIngredients for Kolkata Style Traditional Puchka at Home\n\nFor crispy, crunchy puris:\n\n- Semolina or “sooji.”\n\n- Wheat flour.\n\n- Water to knead.\n\nFor the potato filling\n\n- 3 medium-sized boiled potatoes.\n\n- 1 finely chopped onion (optional).\n\n- 1 or 2 green chillies (boiled or raw).\n\n- Black chickpeas.\n\n- Bengali ‘bhaja’ masala (mix of roasted cumin seeds, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, and red chilli).\n\n- 1/2 teaspoon chaat masala.\n\n- 1/4 teaspoon red chilli powder (optional).\n\n- Black salt or regular salt for taste.\n\n- 1-2 tablespoons of finely chopped coriander leaves.\n\nFor pani puri/puchka tamarind water\n\n- Soaked tamarind.\n\n- 1/2 teaspoon tamarind paste.\n\n- 1/2 cup mint leaves (optional).\n\n- 1/2 cup coriander leaves.\n\n- 1 tablespoon ‘bhaja’ masala.\n\n- 1/2 teaspoon chaat masala.\n\n- 1 to 2 green chillies (chopped or boiled).\n\n- Black salt/regular salt as required.\n\n- Salt/jaggery to taste.\n\nHow to Make Kolkata Style Traditional Puchka\n\nMaking puchka puris.\n\n- Use sooji or semolina primarily for the puri dough, with a tiny bit of wheat flour added for binding.\n\n- Slowly add hot water when mixing the dough, since too much water may cause sloppy fried lumps instead of crispy puris. The dough must be firm without being overly soft.\n\n- Roll the dough out uniformly and thinly to avoid becoming sticky. Uneven rolling out of the dough will leave thick borders or areas that do not swell.\n\n- Make small round balls of dough and roll out individual puris.\n\n- Regulate the oil's temperature between medium and high heat when frying the puris.\n\nThis will ensure that the puris stay crisp even after cooling down, as well as help them puff up instantly.\n\nFor aloo/potato stuffing:\n\nSoak the kala chana or black chickpeas for 6 to 8 hours in hot or normal water.\n\nPressure cook the chickpeas for 2 to 3 whistles with a cup of water and a pinch of salt. After draining the water, set the chana aside.\n\nBoil or steam the potatoes. Peel, smash, and set it aside.\n\nIn a bowl, add the mashed potatoes, chopped onions (optional), chopped coriander leaves, salt, chat masala, roasted cumin seeds, black salt and half a teaspoon of red chilli powder.\n\nAdd boiled chickpeas to it and mix thoroughly.\n\nFor puchka tamarind water\n\nSoak 40 gm (1/2 cup) of tamarind in 1 cup of boiling water for half an hour.\n\nExtract the tamarind juice after 30 minutes, filter it, and throw away the leftover material.\n\nStir the tamarind juice with two and a half cups of cold water.\n\nAdd chopped coriander and mint leaves, roasted cumin seeds, green chilli paste, black salt, a quarter teaspoon red chilli powder, and ½ teaspoon salt.\n\nAdd sugar if needed to taste and put the pani mixture in the fridge until you're ready to serve.\n\nFor serving puchka\n\nGently tap the puri in the middle to create a half-inch hole.\n\nFill the puri with roughly a spoonful of the potato chickpea filling.\n\nPour tamarind water into the puri and serve.\n\n(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani )\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

    "content": "US-Iran nuclear deal: What to know about the tensions between two rivals before their second round of talks\n\nIran was once one of the U.S.’s top allies in the Mideast under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighboring Soviet Union.\n\nBy AP\n\nIran and the United States will hold talks Saturday in Rome, their second round of negotiations over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program.\n\nThe talks follow a first round held in Muscat, Oman, where the two sides spoke face to face.\n\nTalks Amid Tensions\n\nTrump has imposed new sanctions on Iran as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign targeting the country. He has repeatedly suggested military action against Iran remains a possibility while emphasising he still believes a new deal could be reached by writing a letter to Iran’s 85-year-old Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to jump-start these talks.\n\nKhamenei has warned Iran would respond to any attack with an attack of its own.\n\nHere’s what to know about the letter, Iran’s nuclear program and the tensions that have stalked relations between Tehran and Washington since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nAlso Read: US and Ukraine edge closer to strategic mineral deal amid reconstruction talks\n\nTrump dispatched the letter to Khamenei on March 5, then gave a television interview the next day in which he acknowledged sending it. He said: “I’ve written them a letter saying, ‘I hope you’re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing.’”\n\nSince returning to the White House, the president has been pushing for talks while ratcheting up sanctions and suggesting a military strike by Israel or the U.S. could target Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nA previous letter from Trump during his first term drew an angry retort from the supreme leader.\n\nBut Trump’s letters to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in his first term led to face-to-face meetings, though no deals to limit Pyongyang’s atomic bombs and a missile program capable of reaching the continental U.S.\n\nOman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, hosted the first round of talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff last weekend. The two men met face-to-face after indirect talks and immediately agreed to this second round.\n\nWitkoff later made a television appearance in which he suggested 3.67% enrichment for Iran could be something the countries could agree on.\n\nBut that’s exactly the terms set by the 2015 nuclear deal struck under U.S. President Barack Obama, from which Trump unilaterally withdrew America.\n\nWitkoff hours later issued a statement underlining something: “A deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.” Araghchi and Iranian officials have latched onto Witkoff’s comments in recent days as a sign that America was sending it mixed signals about the negotiations.\n\nIran has insisted for decades that its nuclear program is peaceful. However, its officials increasingly threaten to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran now enriches uranium to near weapons-grade levels of 60%, the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so.\n\nUnder the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity and to maintain a uranium stockpile of 300 kilograms (661 pounds). The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran’s program put its stockpile at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds) as it enriches a fraction of it to 60% purity.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.”\n\nAli Larijani, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, has warned in a televised interview that his country has the capability to build nuclear weapons, but it is not pursuing it and has no problem with the International Atomic Energy Agency’s inspections. However, he said if the U.S. or Israel were to attack Iran over the issue, the country would have no choice but to move toward nuclear weapon development.\n\nA Look Back At History\n\n“If you make a mistake regarding Iran’s nuclear issue, you will force Iran to take that path, because it must defend itself,” he said.\n\nIran was once one of the U.S.’s top allies in the Mideast under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighboring Soviet Union. The CIA had fomented a 1953 coup that cemented the shah’s rule.\n\nBut in January 1979, the shah, fatally ill with cancer, fled Iran as mass demonstrations swelled against his rule. The Islamic Revolution followed, led by Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and created Iran’s theocratic government.\n\nLater that year, university students overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seeking the shah’s extradition and sparking the 444-day hostage crisis that saw diplomatic relations between Iran and the U.S. severed. The Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s saw the U.S. back Saddam Hussein. The “Tanker War” during that conflict saw the U.S. launch a one-day assault that crippled Iran at sea, while the U.S. later shot down an Iranian commercial airliner that the American military said it mistook for a warplane.\n\nIran and the U.S. have see-sawed between enmity and grudging diplomacy in the years since, with relations peaking when Tehran made the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. But Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord, sparking tensions in the Mideast that persist today.\n\nAlso Read: 'A complete meltdown in Pentagon' after three high-level firings\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

    "content": "By CNBCTV18.com\n\nIndian skipper Rohit Sharma on Friday said that it was an unreal feeling to have a stand named after him at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.\n\nThe Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) had recently announced that they will be dedicating specific stands in Rohit’s name, also that of ex-chief selector Ajit Wadekar alongside former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sharad Pawar.\n\n“No one dreams of things like this when they are just starting off playing cricket,” said Rohit after being announced as the brand ambassador of the third edition of the T20 Mumbai League.\n\nRohit reflected on his younger days, when he used to stand outside of Wankhede Stadium to catch a glimpse of Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy players.\n\n“I still remember those days when I used to stand outside (the) Wankhede Stadium just to enter and watch Mumbai Ranji Trophy team practice; I am talking about 2004 or maybe 2003.\n\n“We used to finish our U-14, U-16 training at Azad Maidan. Me, with a few of my friends, used to travel across the railway track to go and just get a glimpse of some of the Ranji Trophy cricketers,” he added.\n\nRohit continued, “I know how tough it was to get inside the Wankhede Stadium back then. Even now, obviously, no random (people) will be allowed inside the stadium… but those were the days.”\n\nThe Level 3 of the Divecha Pavilion at the Wankhede Stadium will be named after Rohit.\n\n“Now, to sit back and think that there is going to be a stadium stand in my name, it is such an unreal feeling. It is something that I have never thought of and I will be forever grateful for this big honour in my life,” he said.\n\n“Like I said, when you start playing the game, you don't know how long you are going to play the game for; let alone all these milestones and achievements that you achieve.\n\n“But to get this kind of honour, having a stand named after you, is something that I cannot imagine. Once I see my name there on the stand, it will be a very emotional moment for me,” he said.\n\n“From not having to enter the stadium and now to having a stand — those two moments — so much has happened between these two moments. So, I am forever grateful,” he added.\n\nRohit said that players from across the country are professional, but admitted that there is an X-factor about the culture, history, and legacy of Mumbai cricket that makes it a cut above the rest.\n\n“If you look at the Indian team in the 1970s and 80s, there were eight or nine cricketers representing India from Mumbai. It's just because of pure talent,” he said.\n\n“Every cricketer in India is quite professional. I cannot draw any comparison between Mumbai and outside cricketers but all I can say is that Mumbai cricket has such a rich culture, legacy, and history.\n\n“When you are growing up, to be part of Mumbai cricket, you know that you are into something which is not going to be so easy so you better be at your best, better give everything that you have in you because there is no easy way of getting in there,” he said.\n\nHe added that it is not everyone’s cup of tea to play for Mumbai, and appreciated their mammoth record of winning 42 Ranji Trophy titles.\n\n“It is not everyone's cup of tea to come and represent Mumbai. When I (was) selected for Mumbai (and) I entered the dressing room for the first time, my legs were shaking.\n\n“There were a lot of cricketers like Amol Muzumdar, Wasim Jaffer, Nilesh Kulkarni, Sairaj Bahutule, Ramesh Powar… all these guys were sitting there,” he recalled.\n\n“I was looking around (thinking) where should I sit? Will I get a place or not? All these cricketers we’d grown up watching. Suddenly, if you see yourself with them, you are always feeling very nervous, you don't know what to do and how to react.”\n\nHe explained that the senior professionals in the team helped him feel comfortable with the dressing room encipherment early on.\n\n“I remember there were a few guys slightly older to me. They got me in, they made me comfortable. That's only because (of) the kind of aura these guys had, the achievement that they've had of Mumbai cricket.\n\n“Mumbai has won 42 titles. I think the next best is somewhere around 7 or 8, if I'm not wrong. So you can see the difference,” he said.\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

The men's winner of the race had a time of 1 hour and 2 minutes.\n\nBy Reuters\n\nTwenty-one humanoid robots joined thousands of runners at the Yizhuang half-marathon in Beijing on Saturday, the first time these machines have raced alongside humans over a 21-km (13-mile) course.\n\nThe robots from Chinese manufacturers such as DroidVP and Noetix Robotics came in all shapes and sizes, some shorter than 120 cm (3.9 ft), others as tall as 1.8 m (5.9 ft). One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile.\n\nSome firms tested their robots for weeks before the race.

I feel I'm witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe robots were accompanied by human trainers, some of whom had to physically support the machines during the race.\n\nA few of the robots wore running shoes, with one donning boxing gloves and another wearing a red headband with the words \"Bound to Win\" in Chinese.\n\nThe winning robot was Tiangong Ultra, from the Beijing Innovation Center of Human Robotics, with a time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. The men's winner of the race had a time of 1 hour and 2 minutes.\n\nThe centre is 43% owned by two state-owned enterprises, while tech giant Xiaomi’s robotics arm and leading Chinese humanoid robot firm UBTech have equal share in the rest.\n\nAlso Read: OpenAI's India focus is on low-bandwidth performance, expanding support to more languages\n\nTang Jian, chief technology officer for the robotics centre, said Tiangong Ultra’s performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon.\n\n\"I don't want to boast but I think no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangong's sporting achievements,\" Tang said, adding that the robot switched batteries just three times during the race.\n\nSome Robots Struggle\n\nSome robots, like Tiangong Ultra, completed the race, while others struggled from the beginning. One robot fell at the starting line and lay flat for a few minutes before getting up and taking off. One crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over.\n\nAlthough humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons in China over the past year, this is the first time they have raced alongside humans.\n\nChina is hoping that investment in frontier industries like robotics can help create new engines of economic growth. Some analysts, though, question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential.\n\nAlan Fern, professor of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics at Oregon State University, said contrary to claims from Beijing officials that such a race requires \"AI breakthroughs\", the software enabling humanoid robots to run was developed and demonstrated more than five years ago.\n\n\"Chinese companies have really focused on showing off walking, running, dancing, and other feats of agility.\n\n\"Generally, these are interesting demonstrations, but they don't demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence,\" Fern said.\n\nTang, the robotic centre's CTO, said: \"A focus going forward for us will be industrial applications for humanoid robots so they can truly enter factories, business scenarios, and finally households.\"\n\nAlso Read: AI will transform coding, not kill it: OpenAI’s Kevin Weil\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

    "link": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/photos/economy/china-speeds-up-spending-to-counter-trump-tariffs-19591061.htm",
    "content": "The combined expenditure in the general public budget and the government fund account, China’s two main fiscal books, rose to 9.26 trillion yuan ($1.3 trillion) in the first three months, an increase of 5.6% from the same period a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data released by the Ministry of Finance on Friday. That was the strongest gain for the first quarter in three years.\n\nThe numbers meant nearly 22% of the outlays planned for the full year was spent in the period, faster than 21.6% at the same point last year. China has to strengthen public spending to shield the economy as surging American tariffs could send its exports into contraction while a years-long housing market downturn and deflation keep consumer and business sentiment weak. Its growth held up in January-March, but economists broadly expect it to slow sharply from the second quarter after the wave of export front-loading passes and benefits from a consumer trade-in program taper off. File photo: Chinese President Xi Jinping arrives at the Great Hall of the People on the day of the opening session of the National People's Congress (NPC), in Beijing, China March 5, 2025. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang\n\nSeveral major banks have downgraded their forecast on China’s expansion this year to 4% or lower, well below the government’s goal of around 5%. Officials are focusing on implementing supportive measures announced at last month’s parliamentary session, although they also said they have ample scope and tools to add stimulus when necessary.\n\nFaster tax rebate payouts have been cited by some analysts as an option to help offset some squeeze posed by US tariffs on exporters. The payout as a share of exports last month came in at 11%, only up slightly from the level a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on official data. Image source: Bloomberg\n\nThe property downturn remained a drag on government income last month, with land sales shrinking 16.5% on year and real estate-related revenues falling 0.1%.\n\nTax revenue declined on year for a second straight month while the increase in non-tax income almost halved. Local authorities rushed to sell bonds to swap the so-called “hidden debt” onto their books in a program aimed at alleviating their cash strains and reducing excessive fines imposed on businesses, which are a source of non-tax income.\n\nThe continued contraction in land sales and tax revenues meant total income under the two major budgets fell 2.6% on year to 6.94 trillion yuan in the first quarter. The gap between government income and spending broadened as a result, with the broad budget deficit soaring 41% on year to 2.3 trillion yuan.",

We are focused on making the car go faster, that’s where our focus is. Max is a part of that, he’s a committed member of the team. The rest is all speculation.\"\n\nHorner was probed whether Verstappen was not thinking about his future either, to which he responded, \"Yes, absolutely\".\n\n\"People will always have their concerns. As a team we are focused on sorting the car out. Sort the car out and it doesn’t even become a discussion point.\"\n\nItalian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport suggested without citing any sources htat Aston Martin were prepared offer Verstappen $88 million a year for three years. The team is controlled by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, and they have Saudi energy behemoth Aramco as their title sponsor. They have taken Red Bull's top designer Adrian Newey away from them and Honda is also switching to them next year.\n\nVerstappen has a contract running till 2028, subject to exit clauses, and has been previously linked to Mercedes since Lewis Hamilton left for Ferrari.\n\nMcLaren boss Zak Brown had revealed last year that he was anticipating the four-time world champion to join Mercedes, but the team's strategy head James Vowles, now leading Williams, is not confident about the same.\n\n\"(Verstappen winning in) Japan was for me jaw-dropping, well done to him, but he comes with a lot of downsides as well that you have to acknowledge,\" he told reporters over brunch.\n\n\"And I think what Mercedes does have is a great culture with two drivers that are delivering near to the peak of the car and with one that's on the way up.\n\n\"So I personally don't think there's a place for (Verstappen).\"\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

If you don't get a start, we are still doing well. So you have that cushion that you can go from the same team,\" Axar told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\"So I was thinking, the box isn't getting ticked but at the same time we are winning and he is such a player, that the day he gets going he will hand you the match.\"\n\nAxar also reflected on his captaincy credentials in his maiden stint in the leadership position at the franchise.\n\n\"I was captaining for state cricket, I know what to do and what not to do.

I am backing myself. I am not captaining for the first time. There is planning, which is for my awareness that what's going on, how the other team is playing. Obviously, sometimes it works.\n\n\"But as a captain, I see who is in form, how their day is going, what they can do and what they can't. I choose according to the situation. I am not completely data driven,\" he added.\n\nAxar also clarified that vice-captain Faf du Plessis could return into the XI after sitting out of the last couple of matches owing to an unspecified injury.\n\n\"I had been told that he wouldn't be able to play three matches -- that's the time he needs to recover -- and two matches are done.

RR are enduring a three-game-long losing streak and now there is uncertainty regarding captain Sanju Samson's availability for this match too.

    "content": "U.S. and Iranian negotiators are set for a second round of preliminary nuclear talks in Rome on Saturday.\n\nBy Reuters\n\nIsrael has not ruled out an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities in the coming months despite President Donald Trump telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the U.S. was for now unwilling to support such a move, according to an Israeli official and two other people familiar with the matter.\n\nIsraeli officials have vowed to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and Netanyahu has insisted that any negotiation with Iran must lead to the complete dismantling of its nuclear program.\n\nU.S. and Iranian negotiators are set for a second round of preliminary nuclear talks in Rome on Saturday.\n\nOver the past months, Israel has proposed to the Trump administration a series of options to attack Iran’s facilities, including some with late spring and summer timelines, the sources said. The plans include a mix of airstrikes and commando operations that vary in severity and could set back Tehran's ability to weaponize its nuclear program by just months or a year or more, the sources said.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Wednesday that Trump told Netanyahu in a White House meeting earlier this month that Washington wanted to prioritize diplomatic talks with Tehran and that he was unwilling to support a strike on the country’s nuclear facilities in the short term.\n\nBut Israeli officials now believe that their military could instead launch a limited strike on Iran that would require less U.S. support. Such an attack would be significantly smaller than those Israel initially proposed.\n\nIt is unclear if or when Israel would move forward with such a strike, especially with talks on a nuclear deal getting started. Such a move would likely alienate Trump and could risk broader U.S. support for Israel.\n\nParts of the plans were previously presented last year to the Biden administration, two former senior Biden administration officials told Reuters. Almost all required significant U.S. support via direct military intervention or intelligence sharing. Israel has also requested that Washington help Israel defend itself should Iran retaliate.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, the U.S. National Security Council referred Reuters to comments Trump made on Thursday, when he told reporters he has not waved Israel off an attack but that he was not \"in a rush\" to support military action against Tehran.\n\n“I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death,” Trump said. “That's my first option. If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran, and I think Iran is wanting to talk.”\n\nThe Israeli prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A senior Israeli official told Reuters that no decision has been made yet on an Iranian strike.\n\nA senior Iranian security official said Tehran was aware of Israeli planning and that an attack would provoke \"a harsh and unwavering response from Iran.\"\n\n\"We have intelligence from reliable sources that Israel is planning a major attack on Iran's nuclear sites. This stems from dissatisfaction with ongoing diplomatic efforts regarding Iran’s nuclear program, and also from Netanyahu’s need for conflict as a means of political survival,\" the official told Reuters.\n\nBIDEN ADMINISTRATION PUSHBACK\n\nNetanyahu received pushback from the Biden administration when he presented an earlier version of the plan. The former senior Biden officials said Netanyahu wanted the U.S. to take the lead on airstrikes but the Biden White House told Israel it did not believe a strike was prudent unless Tehran moved to accelerate its enrichment of nuclear material or expel inspectors from the country.\n\nThe Biden officials also questioned the extent to which Israel’s military could effectively carry out such an attack.\n\nFormer officials and experts have long said that Israel would need significant U.S. military support – and weapons – to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities and stockpiles, some of which are in underground facilities.\n\nWhile the more limited military strike Israel is considering would require less direct assistance - particularly in the form of U.S. bombers dropping bunker-busting munitions that can reach deeply buried facilities - Israel would still need a promise from Washington that it would help Israel defend itself if attacked by Tehran in the aftermath, the sources said.\n\nAny attack would carry risks. Military and nuclear experts say that even with massive firepower, a strike would probably only temporarily set back a program the West says aims to eventually produce a nuclear bomb, although Iran denies it.\n\nIsraeli officials have told Washington in recent weeks that they do not believe U.S. talks with Iran should move forward to the deal-making stage without a guarantee that Tehran will not have the ability to create a nuclear weapon.\n\n\"This can be done by agreement, but only if this agreement is Libyan style: They go in, blow up the installations, dismantle all of the equipment, under American supervision,\" Netanyahu said following his talks with Trump. \"The second possibility is ... that they (Iran) drag out the talks and then there is the military option.\"\n\nFrom Israel's perspective, this may be a good moment for a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.\n\nIran allies Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been hammered by Israel since the Gaza war began, while the Houthi movement in Yemen has been targeted by U.S. airstrikes. Israel also severely damaged Iran's air defense systems in an exchange of fire in October 2024.\n\nA top Israeli official, speaking with reporters earlier this month, recognized there was some urgency if the goal was to launch a strike before Iran rebuilds its air defenses. But the senior official refused to state any timeline for possible Israeli action and said discussing this would be \"pointless\".\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

    "content": "Anti-Trump protests on April 19: All about 50501 Movement, activist network mobilising support\n\nThe 50501 Movement has declared April 19 as a ‘Day of Action’. The group asked local organisers to initiate their own protests against the Trump administration’s “abuse of executive power, the SAVE Act and the potential misuse of the Insurrection Act of 1807.”\n\nBy CNBCTV18.com\n\nThousands of people across the United States are set to protest against President Donald Trump on April 19. Organised by the 50501 Movement, around 400 anti-Trump demonstrations will take place on Saturday, Axios reported. The demonstrations will take place in major cities like Chicago, Houston and Portland, among others.\n\nThe 50501 Movement, which stands for 50 protests, 50 states, 1 movement, has declared April 19 as a ‘Day of Action’. The activist group asked local organisers to initiate their own protests against the Trump administration’s “abuse of executive power, the SAVE Act and the potential misuse of the Insurrection Act of 1807.”\n\nThe demonstrations organised by the grassroots movement follow similar protests during the ‘Hands Off’ rally on April 9. The rally was the largest single-day protest organised during Trump’s second term.\n\nThe 50501 Movement is also calling for demonstrations against Elon Musk and the cuts put in place by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In addition, ‘Tesla Takedown’ events are planned in cities like Portland, Oregon, the USA Today reported.\n\n50501 Movement: All you need to know\n\nInitially started on Reddit, 50501 Movement is a grassroots activist network that is built on decentralised mobilisation. It first came into prominence on February 5, with a nationwide protest days after Trump’s inauguration. Since then, the group has organised several peaceful anti-Trump demonstrations, including the ‘Hands Off’ rally on April 9. Millions across the country took to the streets during the ‘Hands Off ' protest.\n\nAs per 50501 Movement’s website, the organisation aims to show “that the American working class will not sit idly by as plutocrats rip apart their democratic institutions and civil liberties while undermining the rule of law.”\n\nAccording to the Movement’s Substack page, the April 19 event will lend support to Americans who have lost their jobs, lost access to food (food stamps, pantries struggling to remain open), impacted by the stock market crashing due to tariff announcements and trying to meet increases in the cost of living.\n\nApart from protests, the events will include environmental clean-ups and donation drives. The 50501 Movement aims to create a ‘social support web’ for Americans as Donald Trump’s policies affect the lives of common people, especially those in marginalised communities.\n\nThe date of April 19 was chosen by the organisers in order to commemorate the anniversary of the Battle of Lexington and Concord, an event which took place during the American Revolutionary War in 1775, as “a historic reminder of resistance to tyranny.”\n\nThe Trump administration has come under sharp criticism for its policies over the last few months, including mass layoffs by DOGE at federal agencies, attempts to deport legal residents, reciprocal tariffs on most nations, including American allies and funding freezes for private universities for refusing to submit to increased oversight, the Washington Post reported.\n\n(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani )\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

Other layoffs and policies have been subjected to stop-and-go litigation and court orders.\n\nBy AP\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's attempt to fire nearly everyone at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was paused on Friday by a federal judge, who said she was “deeply concerned” about the plan and issued an order warning that administration officials appeared to be “thumbing their nose” at the courts.\n\nThe decision leaves in limbo a bureau created after the Great Recession to safeguard against fraud, abuse and deceptive practices. Trump administration officials argue that it has overstepped its authority and should have a more limited mission.\n\nOn Thursday, the administration officials moved to fire roughly 1,500 people, leaving around 200 employees, through a reduction in force that would dramatically downsize the bureau.\n\nAlso Read: Trump admin studying option to fire Fed chief Powell\n\nU.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she was worried the layoffs would violate earlier court decisions. In her written order, she said the administration was poised to “decimate the agency and render it unable to comply with its statutory duties.” If the plan were allowed to proceed, “there will be no agency standing” by the time she renders a decision on an earlier lawsuit filed by an employee union that wants to preserve the bureau.\n\nHer harsh language is the latest example of friction between the executive and judicial branches, which has increased as Trump aggressively flexes his presidential power.\n\n“There is reason to believe,” Jackson wrote, that administration officials “are thumbing their nose\" at judges who have ruled against them.\n\nShe scheduled a hearing on April 28 to hear testimony from officials who worked on the reduction in force, or RIF.\n\n“I’m willing to resolve it quickly, but I’m not going to let this RIF go forward until I have,” she said during a hearing on Friday.\n\nAlso Read: Trump's attack on Powell threaten the Fed's independence--why it matters\n\nTrump's plans have often faced legal hurdles as he works to reshape the federal government, saying it’s rife with fraud, waste and abuse.

The supervision division faces an even deeper reduction, from 487 to 50, plus a relocation from Washington to the Southeastern region.\n\nBefore Friday’s hearing, attorneys for the National Treasury Employees Union filed a sworn statement from a CFPB employee identified only by the pseudonym Alex Doe. The employee said Gavin Kliger, a member of DOGE, was managing the agency’s RIF team charged with sending layoff notices.\n\n“He kept the team up for 36 hours straight to ensure that the notices would go out yesterday,” the employee said. “Gavin was screaming at people he did not believe were working fast enough to ensure they could go out on this compressed timeline, calling them incompetent.”\n\nThe bureau’s chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, told the judge that he believes Kliger is an Office of Personnel Management employee detailed to the CFPB and doesn’t work directly for DOGE.\n\nJackson said she will require Kliger to attend and possibly testify at the April 28 hearing. She said she wants to know why he was there “and what we was doing.”\n\n“We’re not going to decide what happened until we know what happened,” Jackson said.\n\nAlso Read: Trump says Powell will be out fast if the President wants it\n\nThe pseudonymous employee said team members raised concerns that the bureau had to conduct a “particularized assessment” before it could implement an RIF. Paoletta told them to ignore those concerns and move forward with mass firings, adding that “leadership would assume the risk,” the employee stated.\n\nWhite House officials did not immediately respond to questions about the judge's decision or the employee's court declaration.\n\nAn OPM spokesperson said Kliger didn’t manage the CFPB reduction in force and dismissed the allegation as part of an effort to diminish DOGE’s ability to achieve its mission.

    "content": "White House promotes lab leak theory of COVID-19 origins on revamped website; targets Biden, Fauci\n\nThe Covid.gov website accused Biden and Fauci for advancing what it termed the \"preferred narrative that Covid-19 originated naturally.”\n\nBy CNBCTV18.com\n\nThe White House has doubled down on its contentious theory that the coronavirus originated from a lab leak in China in its newly unveiled COVID-19 website. Under the new administration, the White House has launched a revamped website about COVID-19 that promotes the ‘lab leak’ theory and also criticises former US President Joe Biden, the World Health Organization (WHO) and Anthony Fauci, the former top US health official.\n\nThe Covid.gov website, unveiled on Friday, was earlier focused on disseminating vaccine and testing information. It now includes President Donald Trump’s full-length image and what it claims are the ‘true origins’ of the pandemic. More than one million have died of coronavirus and related illnesses in the United States since 2020.\n\nAccording to AFP, the White House ’s new coronavirus website presents five bullet points on the lab leak theory. The site stated that Wuhan, which is where the first known coronavirus case was detected, contains China's ‘foremost SARS research lab,’ which has been conducting ‘inadequate biosafety levels’ for a long time.\n\n“By nearly all measures of science, if there were evidence of a natural origin, it would have already surfaced. But it hasn't,” the website mentioned.\n\nThe website was also critical of measures enacted by the Biden administration during the pandemic, such as social distancing, mask mandates and lockdowns. It accused Biden and Fauci for advancing what it termed the “preferred narrative that Covid-19 originated naturally.”\n\nThe revamped portal, under the ‘COVID-19 misinformation’ section, accused public health officials under the Biden administration of not stating the benefits of ‘alternative treatments’ and collaborating with social media companies to censor dissenting views, particularly those by conservatives, about the pandemic.\n\nThis charge has frequently been levied by Trump supporters against the Biden administration.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report, Fauci, Biden and WHO did not provide any immediate comments on the website or the accusations.\n\nAs for China, the country has been critical of the lab leak theory since it first originated. In January, after the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) changed its official stance to state that it was ‘more likely’ that the coronavirus originated from a leak at a Chinese lab rather than natural transmission from animals, Beijing said that the accusations had no credibility.\n\nThe Chinese government had accused the US of politicising the origins of the coronavirus.\n\nThe revamped website comes amid two big changes in US policy- the escalating trade war with China and the appointment of known vaccine sceptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr as the health secretary. Kennedy and Trump have also initiated widespread job cuts in the US health department. According to reports, 10,000 people could be laid off from the agency.\n\n(Edited by : Sudarsanan Mani )\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

    "content": "US-Iran nuclear deal: What to know about the tensions between two rivals before their second round of talks\n\nIran was once one of the U.S.’s top allies in the Mideast under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighboring Soviet Union.\n\nBy AP\n\nIran and the United States will hold talks Saturday in Rome, their second round of negotiations over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program.\n\nThe talks follow a first round held in Muscat, Oman, where the two sides spoke face to face.\n\nTalks Amid Tensions\n\nTrump has imposed new sanctions on Iran as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign targeting the country. He has repeatedly suggested military action against Iran remains a possibility while emphasising he still believes a new deal could be reached by writing a letter to Iran’s 85-year-old Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to jump-start these talks.\n\nKhamenei has warned Iran would respond to any attack with an attack of its own.\n\nHere’s what to know about the letter, Iran’s nuclear program and the tensions that have stalked relations between Tehran and Washington since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nAlso Read: US and Ukraine edge closer to strategic mineral deal amid reconstruction talks\n\nTrump dispatched the letter to Khamenei on March 5, then gave a television interview the next day in which he acknowledged sending it. He said: “I’ve written them a letter saying, ‘I hope you’re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it’s going to be a terrible thing.’”\n\nSince returning to the White House, the president has been pushing for talks while ratcheting up sanctions and suggesting a military strike by Israel or the U.S. could target Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nA previous letter from Trump during his first term drew an angry retort from the supreme leader.\n\nBut Trump’s letters to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in his first term led to face-to-face meetings, though no deals to limit Pyongyang’s atomic bombs and a missile program capable of reaching the continental U.S.\n\nOman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, hosted the first round of talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff last weekend. The two men met face-to-face after indirect talks and immediately agreed to this second round.\n\nWitkoff later made a television appearance in which he suggested 3.67% enrichment for Iran could be something the countries could agree on.\n\nBut that’s exactly the terms set by the 2015 nuclear deal struck under U.S. President Barack Obama, from which Trump unilaterally withdrew America.\n\nWitkoff hours later issued a statement underlining something: “A deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.” Araghchi and Iranian officials have latched onto Witkoff’s comments in recent days as a sign that America was sending it mixed signals about the negotiations.\n\nIran has insisted for decades that its nuclear program is peaceful. However, its officials increasingly threaten to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran now enriches uranium to near weapons-grade levels of 60%, the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so.\n\nUnder the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity and to maintain a uranium stockpile of 300 kilograms (661 pounds). The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran’s program put its stockpile at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds) as it enriches a fraction of it to 60% purity.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has “undertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.”\n\nAli Larijani, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, has warned in a televised interview that his country has the capability to build nuclear weapons, but it is not pursuing it and has no problem with the International Atomic Energy Agency’s inspections. However, he said if the U.S. or Israel were to attack Iran over the issue, the country would have no choice but to move toward nuclear weapon development.\n\nA Look Back At History\n\n“If you make a mistake regarding Iran’s nuclear issue, you will force Iran to take that path, because it must defend itself,” he said.\n\nIran was once one of the U.S.’s top allies in the Mideast under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighboring Soviet Union. The CIA had fomented a 1953 coup that cemented the shah’s rule.\n\nBut in January 1979, the shah, fatally ill with cancer, fled Iran as mass demonstrations swelled against his rule. The Islamic Revolution followed, led by Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and created Iran’s theocratic government.\n\nLater that year, university students overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seeking the shah’s extradition and sparking the 444-day hostage crisis that saw diplomatic relations between Iran and the U.S. severed. The Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s saw the U.S. back Saddam Hussein. The “Tanker War” during that conflict saw the U.S. launch a one-day assault that crippled Iran at sea, while the U.S. later shot down an Iranian commercial airliner that the American military said it mistook for a warplane.\n\nIran and the U.S. have see-sawed between enmity and grudging diplomacy in the years since, with relations peaking when Tehran made the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. But Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord, sparking tensions in the Mideast that persist today.\n\nAlso Read: 'A complete meltdown in Pentagon' after three high-level firings\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

    "content": "'A complete meltdown in Pentagon' after three high-level firings\n\nThe Pentagon has been in the centre of controversies in Donald Trump's second term as US President. Amid two separate probes, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reportedly fired three senior officials including his closest aide.\n\nBy CNBCTV18.com\n\nThree Pentagon officials were fired on Friday, reports Politico, a US-based publication, citing three anonymous sources. The three people whose services were terminated include Senior advisor Dan Caldwell, Darin Selnick (the deputy chief of staff under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth), and Colin Carroll, who is the chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Stephen Feinberg.\n\nThe developments at America's defense headquarters come amidst a probe into two serious lapses. One of them was the sharing of sensitive information in the group chat (where the officials inadvertently added a journalist) on the Signal app.\n\nThe other was the leak to the New York Times where unnamed officials revealed details of Elon Musk's visit to the Pentagon where the billionaire was briefed about the US' planning for any potential war with China. Both US President Donald Trump and his Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had dismissed the report.\n\n“There is a complete meltdown in the building, and this is really reflecting on the secretary’s leadership,” said a senior defense official told Politico. Two of the three people fired today plan to sue the US government for wrongful termination, the report added.\n\n(Edited by : Sriram Iyer )\n\nCheck out our in-depth Market Coverage, Business News & get real-time Stock Market Updates on CNBC-TV18.

He inserted a prayer into the wall, which he said was handwritten by U.S. President Donald Trump. Huckabee said every effort was being made to bring home the remaining hostages held by Hamas.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251.

    "content": "The 35-year-old from London, who is also raising money for the Chinmaya Mission, a Hindu religious and spiritual organisation, said she wants to pay tribute to the work the mission does globally. “I wanted to pay tribute to the work that’s done by the organisation worldwide,” Brahmacharini Chaitanya told the PA news agency.\n\nChinmaya Mission is a global organisation that works to provide accessible education on the Hindu philosophy of non duality to anyone in the world, regardless of their background, upbringing. “We’re focused on that philosophy of non duality that comes from Hinduism, that is about recognising oneness.”\n\nBrahmacharini Chaitanya, who left the UK after studying in India, has been serving her community in London for the last seven years as a teacher. She is also an author and podcast host and is regularly featured on BBC Radio 4’s Prayer For The Day segment.\n\nMs Chaitanya said she was also inspired by Swami Chinmayananda, the founder of the Chinmaya Mission who walked the entire length of India in the 1950s. “He dedicated his whole life kind of in service of the teaching and all the communities that he met,” she said.\n\n“In comparison to that, I think 26 miles is not so bad.” Ms Chaitanya, who started her marathon training in January, said she has relied on spiritual practices and her faith throughout.\n\n“Running a marathon demands immense dedication and perseverance, and my spiritual practices serve as a guiding light throughout the training process and when it comes to the race itself,” she said.\n\n“Spirituality, at its core, is about cultivating a deep awareness and understanding of the mind. “While the marathon is undeniably a physical challenge, it ultimately becomes a profound mental battle.” Brahmacharini Chaitanya says she hopes her taking part in the London Marathon race will help break down stereotypes and foster a greater appreciation for diverse cultures and belief systems.\n\n“By demonstrating that ancient wisdom and modern challenges can co-exist harmoniously, I aim to challenge preconceived notions and open up space for a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be a Hindu or a Brahmacharini,” she said. The TCS London Marathon 2025 will take place on Sunday April 27, with more than 50,000 runners set to take part.",

    "content": "Now of course it takes years and even decades for a launch to transcend 'classic' territory. But the true and blue fashion-aligned demographic knows, and agrees, that the Chanel 25 very much carries the aura of that cushy Midas touch that'll help it seamlessly weather many a fashion seasons.\n\nIt was officially launched in campaigns featuring Jennie and Dua Lipa, shot by David Sims and filmed by Gordon von Steiner — Dua even colour-coded a black Chanel 25 to the Chanel haute couture show held earlier this year in January. Now while celeb-endorsed social currency, especially when it comes to trend pushing doesn't REALLY count for much in an ecosystem which essentially runs off of validation on the gram and bourgeoning visibility on adjacent platforms. BUT, the hullabaloo around the Chanel 25 definitely feels more organic — and the best part is, that this is just because.\n\nSpeaking of the larger luxe flow of luxury bags which have achieved It-Girl status, each cut and its adjoining legacy actually speaks to micro-strains of personally curated aesthetics. After all, luxury buying, at least for everybody but the uber-rich is about personal resonance. And there are way more contendors up for consideration than just the Hermès Birkin or the Hermès Kelly. But for the sake of a slightly more contemporary comparison, we will stick to the legacy of the latter Hermès baby.\n\nThe mini Kelly for one, saw quite the boom in visibility around Fall last year. In much more exciting colours and a very 'I'm too cool to care' vibe, its resurgence can very well be linked to it representing the vibe of the current generation of luxury-toting one-percenters. But the commotion seems to have faded as Winter turned to Spring, save for a few head-turning appearances.\n\nIn the Indian context, Ananya Panday was just announced as the first-ever Chanel brand ambassador for and from India — not very surprising given her very enviable portfolio of brand contracts. But Chanel is unequivocally the most high profile of the lot. The understandably excited post by Ananya announcing the same, also carries one-too-many peaks at her own Chanel 25.\n\nComing back to the Chanel versus Hermès debate, we doubt absolutely anything can contend with the aura of a painstakingly acquired Hermès Birkin, Only time will tell if the Chanel 25 can overtake that too.",

    "content": "Since finishing 2022 on a high, Babar has struggled to find consistency and has been unable to deliver impactful performances across formats. As his bat remains largely silent, the 29-year-old has drawn widespread criticism from fans and former cricketers alike.\n\nAmid his lean patch, questions have been raised about Babar's place in the national side. However, Mushtaq Ahmed has backed the star batter to bounce back and rediscover his best form.\n\n\"Thirty or forty runs mean nothing for Babar. He needs a big knock, not 70 or 80, but a hundred, and he acknowledges that,\" Mushtaq said while speaking to the media, as quoted by Geo News.\n\nBabar's sharp decline in form has coincided with his repeated exits from captaincy. After stepping down as Pakistan's captain across all formats following the conclusion of the ODI World Cup 2023, Shaheen Afridi took over the leadership. However, after just one series, Babar was reinstated as the white-ball captain ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nFollowing the tournament, Babar stepped down once again, marking his second resignation within a year. Mushtaq noted that a lack of support during Babar's struggles added to the pressure.\n\n\"He was under pressure. The lack of support during his tough phase didn't help. He gave five years of consistent performance. Ups and downs are part of a cricketer's journey. But bad performance will only make him stronger,\" Mushtaq said.\n\nSince 2023, Babar has failed to average over 40 across formats. After scoring 151 runs against Nepal in 2023, he has yet to score another century in international cricket.\n\nIn 2025 so far, Babar has played 11 matches for Pakistan, scoring 462 runs at an average of 33.00 and a strike rate of 66.95. He is currently leading Peshawar Zalmi in the ongoing Pakistan Super League but has scored just one run in two matches.",

They are yet to get a victory at their home venue of the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.\n\nSpeaking on JioHotstar's 'Match Centre Live' after the game, Bangar, the JioStar expert for IPL 2025, said, \"They would be worried, to be honest, with the kind of surfaces they are getting. Who would have expected the amount of bounce that was on offer on this pitch? Nobody expected that. If that continues, this is no longer a batting-friendly surface or venue. RCB may need to recalibrate their batting approach to get things back on track in home games.\"\n\nHe continued that a couple of early dismissals were understandable since, in a rain-affected match, they were trying to post a big score, and teams usually do not have an idea of what a big score is in such conditions.\n\n\"But the way Liam Livingstone and Jitesh got out, and you would expect a little more from Krunal Pandya as well those three were disappointing. At one point, they were in danger of being bowled out for under 50. Credit to Tim David though he held on and made a bit of a match out of it with a well-composed drift,\" he concluded.\n\nComing to the match, PBKS won the toss and opted to field first. In a bid to score big, RCB tried to attack and slog at every ball, losing seven wickets for 42 runs in the process. However, a fiery half-century from Tim David helped RCB reach 95/9 in 14 overs.\n\nMarco Jansen , Yuzvendra Chahal , Arshdeep Singh and Harpreet Brar consistently troubled RCB with their bowling.\n\nDuring their run-chase, PBKS also lost some wickets as RCB did not give up easily. PBKS was reduced to 81/5 in 11.3 overs, but Nehal Wadhera kept his calm and guided his side to a win with 11 balls left. Josh Hazlewood was the pick of the bowlers for RCB.\n\nDavid got the 'Player of the Match' award for his fighting knock that gave RCB something to fight for.\n\nWith this win, PBKS went to the number two spot, with five wins, two losses, and 10 points. RCB is at fourth spot with four wins, three losses, and eight points. Both teams will lock horns again on Sunday at the Mullanpur Stadium.",

    "content": "What on Earth are Easter horror films?\n\nAs the name suggests, Easter horror films are horror features that revolve around the Christian holiday, mostly featuring a deranged or maniacal version of the Easter Bunny, transformed from the cute mascot to a killing machine. These films subvert the usual trope of Easter being a festival for children with colourful eggs and a fluffy bunny, turning it all into horror.\n\nThe trend came into mainstream with the 2006 film Easter Bunny, Kill! Kill!, but there had been a few direct-to-video cult successes before that, too. Since then, there has been an abundance of films with the Easter Bunny as the antagonist, including successful franchises like Bunnyman, Beaster Day, and Easter Bunny.\n\nBut why would the Easter Bunny make for a convincing monster?\n\nThe Easter Bunny is a folkloric figure that is the mascot of Easter Sunday. It traces its origins to German Lutherans and became widely popular in the US starting in the 18th century. And while meant to be a cute and adorable figure, the Easter Bunny has been widely divisive. In the mid-20th century, as photography proliferated, Easter festivals would have mascots dressed up as Easter Bunnies clicking pictures with kids, similar to how Santa Claus would do it on Christmas. However, these humanoid bunnies, with their crude costumes, often ended up looking rather creepy.\n\nOver the years, this even developed into a psychological condition called Leporiphobia, the fear of rabbits. The two things combined entered horror in the 80s and 90s, with humanoid bunnies playing some important roles in films like The Shining and Donnie Darko.\n\nBut it wasn't until the 21st century that Hollywood took this fear of creepy bunnies to the extreme and turned the Easter Bunny into a monster. Since then, Easter Bunnies have murdered and gored their way through dozens of low-budget horror flicks, and continue to do so every Easter.",

It needs to be controlled because if it’s not, there’ll be chaos.”\n\nHe added, “There are both good and bad aspects, and the good things should be used to empower people who never had the chance to put their vision into action. But overusing it in a bad way is bad for us. It’s like mixing poison with oxygen and breathing it in. There should be rules, like certain things you can't do. Like, how they talk about ethics or behaviour in a society, this is also behaviour in the software and digital world.”\n\nThe composer had previously given a clarification on using AI to recreate the voices of two late singers for a song in Lal Salaam. He revealed that permission was taken by the families of the legendary singers and were also sent remuneration.\n\nOn the work front, AR Rahman's upcoming project as a music composer is for Mani Ratnam's Thug Life.

    "content": "The 35-year-old from London, who is also raising money for the Chinmaya Mission, a Hindu religious and spiritual organisation, said she wants to pay tribute to the work the mission does globally. “I wanted to pay tribute to the work that’s done by the organisation worldwide,” Brahmacharini Chaitanya told the PA news agency.\n\nChinmaya Mission is a global organisation that works to provide accessible education on the Hindu philosophy of non duality to anyone in the world, regardless of their background, upbringing. “We’re focused on that philosophy of non duality that comes from Hinduism, that is about recognising oneness.”\n\nBrahmacharini Chaitanya, who left the UK after studying in India, has been serving her community in London for the last seven years as a teacher. She is also an author and podcast host and is regularly featured on BBC Radio 4’s Prayer For The Day segment.\n\nMs Chaitanya said she was also inspired by Swami Chinmayananda, the founder of the Chinmaya Mission who walked the entire length of India in the 1950s. “He dedicated his whole life kind of in service of the teaching and all the communities that he met,” she said.\n\n“In comparison to that, I think 26 miles is not so bad.” Ms Chaitanya, who started her marathon training in January, said she has relied on spiritual practices and her faith throughout.\n\n“Running a marathon demands immense dedication and perseverance, and my spiritual practices serve as a guiding light throughout the training process and when it comes to the race itself,” she said.\n\n“Spirituality, at its core, is about cultivating a deep awareness and understanding of the mind. “While the marathon is undeniably a physical challenge, it ultimately becomes a profound mental battle.” Brahmacharini Chaitanya says she hopes her taking part in the London Marathon race will help break down stereotypes and foster a greater appreciation for diverse cultures and belief systems.\n\n“By demonstrating that ancient wisdom and modern challenges can co-exist harmoniously, I aim to challenge preconceived notions and open up space for a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be a Hindu or a Brahmacharini,” she said. The TCS London Marathon 2025 will take place on Sunday April 27, with more than 50,000 runners set to take part.",

Because the situation in India is so volatile, and people will take up positions which are so strong, and religion has become such a big issue. I don’t think you can make a film like Bombay and release in theatre and not expect the theatre to be burnt down today. In 25-30 years time, India has become less tolerant.”\n\nHe also spoke about why Manisha’s character’s burqa gets snagged on an anchor in the song Uyire (Tu Hi Re in Hindi) and how it was not an allegory for her ‘losing faith to be with her lover’. He said that because they had only one costume in the scene, and she was wearing a blue dress, they thought showing it off would be an ‘interesting idea’.\n\n“It was not with the idea of…it was just with the boredom of one dress becoming…we didn’t have any dance master.

    "content": "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Saturday (April 19, 2025) launched ‘Kalaignar Kaivinai Thittam’, an artisan development scheme that would serve as the State government’s alternative to the Centre’s PM Vishwakarma scheme.\n\n“In 2023, the BJP government at the Centre introduced the Vishwakarma scheme. They said the scheme would cover 18 trades and focus on upskilling and providing loans of up to ₹3 lakh. For us, any scheme should have the objective of upholding social justice and equality. However, the Vishwakarma scheme does not have such features,” he said at the launch, organised by the MSME Department on the Sekkizhar Government Boys Higher Secondary School complex in Kundrathur.\n\n“We strongly opposed the Vishwakarma scheme, stating it would strengthen caste-based vocation,” Mr. Stalin said, adding that the scheme is a reflection of the fact that some still hold regressive ideas.\n\n“I was also shocked and pained to see that the minimum age criteria for the Vishwakarma scheme is 18 years. Is 18 years an age to pursue higher education or to push someone towards family-based traditional trade,” he asked. “A government’s duty should be to bring students who drop out back into the educational system and not take them out of education and tell them to pursue family-based traditional trade,” Mr. Stalin noted.\n\n“While our Dravidian model government is working hard to ensure that those who have completed school pursue higher education through the Pudhumai Penn Scheme and Tamil Pudhalvan scheme, the BJP government is working towards encouraging caste-based vocation,” he added.\n\nMr. also recalled that he had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking modifications to the Vishwakarma scheme, including a request to increase the minimum age to 35 years. “However, the Centre refused to make the changes. I wrote to the Union MSME Minister, stating that the State government would not take the PM Vishwakarma scheme forward in its present form,” Mr. Stalin said.\n\n‘More inclusive and comprehensive’\n\n“We decided to come up with an alternative scheme, which is more inclusive and comprehensive, and does not discriminate on the basis of caste. That is how the Kalaignar Kaivinai Thittam scheme was designed,” he said.\n\nThe scheme covers 25 trades. Under the Central scheme, the applicant can only focus on family trade, but under this scheme, one can pursue a trade of their choice, Mr. Stalin said.\n\n“We have fixed the minimum age of 35 years for the Kalaignar Kaivinai Thittam. We provide loans in the range of ₹50,000 to ₹3 lakh with subsidy. In the Centre’s scheme, there is no subsidy. We have, so far, received 24,907 applications for our scheme,” he said.\n\nHe handed over orders of loan approvals to the tune of ₹170 crore, including a subsidy of ₹34 crore, under the Kalaignar Kaivinai Thittam scheme to 8,951 beneficiaries. He also handed over certificates of appreciation to officials of Taico Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Indian Bank, State Bank of India, and Canara Bank for providing loans to a higher number of beneficiaries under the scheme.\n\nFive new announcements\n\nMr. Stalin also made five announcements, including increasing the subsidy provided for applying for Geographical Indications (GI) tags to ₹1 lakh from ₹25,000 and the establishment of a Metrology and Metallurgy laboratory at the cost of ₹5 crore for the benefit of automotive and engineering component manufacturing units in the Ambattur Industrial Estate.\n\nInfrastructure facilities, including road and stormwater drainage work, will be taken up at ₹5 crore in Pazhanthandalam in Kancheepuram district, where a large number of industrial units are located, he said.\n\nIn the Kakkalur Industrial Estate, a training centre for technological skill development and a Common Facility Centre with equipment will be set up at a cost of ₹3.9 crore, Mr. Stalin said.\n\nThe financial assistance provided to micro and small enterprises to put up stalls in domestic exhibitions and trade fairs will be increased from ₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakh, he added.\n\nMr. Stalin also inaugurated three clusters under the Micro Cluster Development Programme. They are: Peravurani Coir Cluster, Thanjavur district, established at a cost of ₹7.29 crore, Jewellery Federation Cluster, Ramanathapuram district, established at a cost of ₹6.72 crore, and Embroidery Stitching Cluster, Thenkasi district, established at the cost of ₹1.15 crore.\n\nThe Chief Minister also presented awards to the best performing MSMEs in the State for 2023-24.\n\nMinister for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises T.M. Anbarasan, DMK MPs T.R. Baalu and Selvam, and Chief Secretary N. Muruganandam, among other officials, were present.",

But gusty winds, hailstorm and rain caused mangoes to drop from the trees.\n\n“We spent thousands of rupees to get a good yield. The unseasonal rains and hailstorms accompanied by gusty winds destroyed our dream,” Mallikarjun Reddy Bilhar told The Hindu.\n\n“The dropped mangoes are damaged. They won’t find buyers even at a lesser price in the market, as customers don’t wish to purchase such fallen fruits,” said Chand Pasha Kurkundi..\n\n“The fate of farmers is like this. Whenever they produce a high quantum of grains or fruits, they either don’t get the price as expected, or risk damage to the produce owing to a natural disaster. The government should announce compensation for loss of mango crop due to unseasonal rains,” Mallanagouda Hagaratagi, a farmer leader, told The Hindu.\n\nA joint survey by the revenue and horticulture departments has been done on the damage so far. A report has been sent to the tahsildar of Wadagera.\n\n“The departments should conduct a proper survey to assess the loss incurred by farmers.” said Ningu Jadi, an activist.",

    "content": "The Andhra Pradesh government has decided to request the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) to allocate eight acres of land in Amaravati’s Thullur region for constructing police accommodation, Minister for Home Vangalapudi Anitha said on Saturday (April 19). The move is part of the coalition government’s broader efforts to enhance infrastructure and safety in the capital region.\n\nSpeaking after a review meeting with Superintendents of Police and senior officers from Guntur, Palnadu, Bapatla, Prakasam, and Nellore districts, the Minister emphasized that the safety of women, children, and the public remains the top priority. Given the presence of the High Court, Secretariat, and party offices in Amaravati, she said security arrangements will be strengthened significantly, adding that additional police personnel would be required in Guntur district.\n\nHighlighting key achievements, she said no cybercrime incidents were reported in Prakasam district in the last three months, and several cases were cracked in Guntur and Bapatla. Cyber awareness campaigns are being intensified across all districts, and efforts are on to sensitize every household through women police.\n\nThe Minister announced plans to modernize police stations and ensure better facilities for on-duty officers. She revealed that 10 new police stations will be established across the State to address rising population and law enforcement demands. Each district will also have a dedicated cybercrime police station.\n\nTo boost surveillance, the government aims to install 5,000–10,000 CCTV cameras per district and has urged residents to support this by installing cameras at homes, shops, and schools. The Minister also acknowledged the revival of key policing technologies such as CCTV networks and body-worn cameras, which were damaged in the previous administration.\n\nShe confirmed that recruitment for 6,000 constable posts is underway and that steps are being taken to resolve pending promotion and court cases, including for the 1995 batch CIs. The government, she asserted, is committed to swift justice, women’s safety, and restoring public confidence in law enforcement.",

    "content": "India's first prototype fast-breeder reactor in Tamil Nadu's Kalpakkam is expected to be commissioned next year, nearly two years after it got the go-ahead from the nuclear regulator, officials have said.\n\nThe commissioning of the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) will mark the second stage of India's three-stage nuclear programme that aims to recycle spent fuel to reduce the inventory of radioactive waste.\n\nThe PFBR being developed in Kalpakkam is the first-of-its-kind nuclear reactor to use plutonium-based mixed oxide as fuel and liquid sodium as coolant. It will also utilise the spent fuel of Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors, which form the mainstay of nuclear power in India at present.\n\nWhile the state-run Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) operates nuclear power plants in the country, the PFBR in Kalpakkam is being developed by the Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam (BHAVINI).\n\n\"BHAVINI's 500 MW PFBR is in the advanced stage of integrated commissioning, with expected first criticality by 2025-26,\" Department of Atomic Energy officials recently told the parliamentary standing committee on science and technology.\n\nThey had told the committee that the first criticality of the PFBR was expected to be achieved in March and the plant would be completed by September 2026.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi witnessed the commencement of core loading in the nuclear reactor in March last year.\n\nLast July, the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) granted permission for loading of fuel, first approach to criticality and conducting low-power physics experiments for the PFBR.\n\nPFBRs are critical for India's nuclear programme as the spent fuel from these reactors will be used to power the thorium-based reactors that form the third stage of the closed fuel cycle.\n\nThe government has announced a nuclear energy mission that aims to produce 100 GW electricity through nuclear power.\n\nAt present, India's installed nuclear power capacity stands at 8.18 GW. An additional 7.30 GW nuclear energy projects are under construction or commissioning and 7.00 GW have been sanctioned and are currently undergoing pre-project activities.\n\nUpon completion of these projects, India's nuclear power capacity is expected to reach 22.48 GW by 2031-32.\n\nBeyond this, NPCIL plans to add another 15.40 GW through indigenous Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors and 17.60 GW through Light Water Reactors with foreign cooperation, bringing the total installed capacity to 55 GW.\n\nAdditionally, BHAVINI is expected to contribute 3.80 GW through Fast Breeder Reactors while the remainder of the capacity will come from Small Modular Reactors, Bharat Small Reactors, and other advanced nuclear technologies developed with private sector collaboration.",

    "content": "The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on April 23 a plea seeking uniformity in granting compensation to the victims of hate crime and mob lynching.\n\nThe apex court had in April 2023 sought responses from the Centre, states and Union Territories (UTs) on the petition filed by 'Indian Muslim for Progress and Reforms' (IMPAR).\n\nIt had asked the Centre, states and UTs to apprise the court of the steps taken for formulating a scheme for providing relief to the families of victims of mob lynching, as directed by the top court in the 2018 verdict in Tehseen Poonawala case.\n\nAccording to the cause list of April 23 uploaded on the top court's website, a bench of Justices B R Gavai and Augustine George Masih is slated to hear the matter.\n\nDuring the hearing before the top court in April 2023, the petitioner's counsel had said some states had framed schemes pursuant to the 2018 verdict but there was no uniformity, while many states still did not have any such scheme.\n\nThe plea said the petitioner was praying for an order or direction to bring in uniformity in the grant of compensation to the victims of hate crimes and mob lynching as the present practice of granting ex-gratia amounts by various states was discriminatory and contrary to the provisions of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution.\n\nIt said the petitioner also prays for an order directing the states and UTs to provide just, fair and reasonable compensation to the victims of hate crime and mob lynching following the scheme framed by them in compliance with the apex court's 2018 direction.\n\nThe petition flagged the alleged \"whimsical, discriminatory and arbitrary approach\" adopted by the states in the grant of ex-gratia to the victims of hate crime and mob lynching and the \"meagre\" compensation provided to them.\n\nThe plea said the compensation awarded by the states in most cases depended on extraneous factors like \"media coverage, political imperatives and the victim's religious identity\".\n\n\"It is seen that the trend of awarding compensation to the victims of hate crime/ mob lynching is decided based on the religious affiliation of the victims. In some cases, where the victims belong to other religious denominations, huge compensation is awarded for their losses, while in other cases where the victim belongs to a minority community, the compensation is woefully inadequate,\" it claimed.",

    "content": "At least 22 families have been shifted as a precautionary measure due to the lurking threat of a landslide in the Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir, a government official said.\n\nTraffic remained suspended on the Kishtwar-Paddar road, connecting the famous Machail Mata shrine for the third day on Saturday (April 19, 2025).\n\nDistrict Development Commissioner Rajesh Kumar Shavan conducted an inspection of the landslide-prone area at Singrah Nallah, Patharnaki along the Kishtwar-Peddar Road with a focus on assessing the vulnerability of the area to landslides and evaluating the progress of mitigation measures in place.\n\n\"We have taken some preventive measures for the safety of the locals due to the continuous sinking and lurking threat of a landslide. Some 22 families at the hilltop village have been evacuated and provided tents and rations. None of the houses have developed any cracks though,\" Nagsini Tehsildar Mohd Rafi Naik told PTI on the phone.\n\nNaik, who is monitoring the situation at the landslide-prone area, said a portion of over 200 metres of the road got damaged due to the sinking, while the continuous shooting stones from the hillock are hampering road clearance operations.\n\nHe said the district administration is alive to the situation and is keeping a close watch to avoid any untoward incident.\n\nMachail Mata shrine was reopened for the pilgrims only a week ago after winter, marking the commencement of the annual yatra season. However, the closure of the road and the threat of the landslide near Pathernaki hit the yatra.\n\nThe local residents blamed massive blasting by the executing agency working on the 624 MW Kiru Hydro-Electric project, a run-of-river scheme, as the reason behind the scary situation.\n\nThe district development commissioner, during his visit to the site on Friday, was briefed by officials from the General Reserve Engineer Force (GREF) on the current status of the ongoing restoration and construction works on the damaged route.\n\nAfter a thorough examination of the site, the DDC issued necessary directions to the GREF authorities to expedite the work while ensuring safety and sustainability, an official said.\n\nHe directed the local administration to stay on high alert and conveyed to the GREF authorities the importance of strengthening the affected section to ensure uninterrupted connectivity and to safeguard commuters, especially during the monsoon season.\n\nThe deputy commissioner advised hydroelectric project authorities to strictly adhere to standard operating procedures (SOPs) to minimise further impact and avoid exacerbating existing cracks.\n\nPathernaki and Kiru segments of the road are highly slide-prone and remain at constant risk of disruptions. Hence, continuous monitoring and prompt responsiveness from all stakeholders remain imperative, the official said.\n\nBJP local MLA Sunil Sharma called for a permanent solution to the issue, saying the area has become prone to frequent landslides over the past one-and-a-half years.\n\n\"The concerned agencies have been managing the slide zone temporarily to avoid traffic disruption but the issue needs a permanent solution,\" he said.\n\nSharma, who is also the leader of the opposition in the legislative assembly, said he had already raised the issue with the deputy commissioner and \"we are looking forward to a permanent solution\" to the issue.\n\nThe closure of the road caused immense hardships to the residents of Paddar and Pangi who are now using an alternate trekking route to move in and out of the region.",

Deb announced Mr. Patnaik as the party president at the state council meeting held at its state headquarters, Sankha Bhawan.\n\nAddressing party leaders and workers after being named as the BJD president, Mr. Patnaik said, “We conceded defeat in the last Assembly election by a narrow margin, even though our party got more votes. This is because we couldn’t effectively counter the false narrative. Creating a false narrative is the main strategy against the BJD. We should be aggressive in exposing this, especially on social media.”\n\nThe Leader of Opposition in the Odisha Assembly also said, “We need to improve our social media presence.

The spirit of BJD workers remains very high. They are our real assets.”\n\n“I have full faith in BJD workers, brothers and sisters. They are the ones who will give a befitting reply to the propaganda. They will spread the message of our service to every village and city of Odisha,” Mr. Patnaik said.\n\nHe described the 2000-2024 period as the ‘golden age’, as the BJD ruled Odisha during these years.\n\nCommencing his speech with the ‘Jai Jagannath’ chant, Mr. Patnaik said that the ideology of his father, Biju Patnaik, continued to remain the guiding principle of the BJD.\n\n“Our principles and ideals are our strength. Whether in the government or not, the Biju Janata Dal has always served the people of Odisha and will continue to do so,” he said.\n\nClaiming that the welfare of the people of Odisha is the BJD’s focus, Mr. Patnaik said empowerment of women, farmers, youth, workers, tribals and regional development is his party’s priority.\n\n“The BJD has been working for the pride of Odisha and the state’s interests.

    "content": "Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K. Selvaperunthagai on Saturday (April 19, 2025) said that the recent increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel by ₹2 per litre by the Centre is an example of “Modi government’s tax terrorism.”\n\nIn a statement, the Congress leader said when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government stepped down, the excise duty on petrol and diesel was ₹9.20 and ₹3.46, respectively. Since then, the excise duty has increased by 357% for petrol and 54% for diesel. “There is no further evidence required than this, of the [Narendra] Modi government’s tax terrorism,” he alleged.\n\nDuring the tenure of the UPA government, when there was a drop in international crude oil prices, the prices of petrol and diesel were also reduced accordingly. Even when crude oil was priced at $110 per barrel, the UPA government provided nearly ₹2 lakh crore as subsidies annually to avoid burdening people, he said.\n\n“The crude oil prices have fallen by 40% since 2014. But from 2014 to 2025, due to the imposition of higher excise duty on petrol and diesel, the Union government has collected ₹39.54 lakh crore in taxes. This is a clear example of an anti-people policy,” Mr. Selvaperunthagai added.",

    "content": "Aggrieved teachers of West Bengal have continued their protests across the State, even after the Supreme Court on April 17 allowed untainted teaching candidates to continue working until the West Bengal School Service Commission (SSC) completes fresh recruitments by December 31.\n\nOn Saturday (April 19, 2025), aggrieved, untainted teachers carried out protest rallies across several districts in West Bengal, reiterating their demands for the segregation of tainted and untainted candidates. In the Esplanade area of Central Kolkata, a group of protesting teachers is continuing their ongoing sit-in demonstration.\n\nThe Supreme Court on April 3 this year rendered the entire recruitment panel by the SSC in 2016 null and void owing to “egregious violations and illegalities, which violated Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.”\n\nThat resulted in the loss of employment for over 25,000 teaching and non-teaching staff in State-run schools, leading to widespread agitations across West Bengal. The protestors’ primary demand was the segregation of untainted and tainted candidates from the panel of job appointments.\n\nOn Friday (April 18, 2025), Education Minister Bratya Basu hinted at the likelihood of the school service commission publishing a list of terminated teaching and non-teaching staff on Monday, April 21, marking them as either “tainted” or “not specifically tainted”.\n\n“So far, we have heard many promises. But we do not trust verbal reassurances and empty promises anymore. We will not stop our agitations till we see the segregated list with our own eyes. Once the list is given to us, we will decide our future course of action,” Mehboob Mondal, the spokesperson of the ‘Deserving Teachers’ Rights Forum’, told The Hindu on Saturday.\n\nHe added that the Supreme Court’s recent order for untainted candidates to continue working till fresh recruitments also does not offer them much reassurance till the list of tainted and untainted candidates is published.\n\n“On Monday, April 21, we have planned an agitation outside the SSC Bhawan in Salt Lake, and on Tuesday, April 22, we will take out a rally to the Governor’s residence at Raj Bhawan,” Mr Mondal said.\n\nNotably, on Saturday, a group of 70 representatives of the Deserving Teachers’ Rights Forum are returning to Kolkata from New Delhi, after an agitation at Jantar Mantar in the capital city on April 16 and meetings with different teachers’ organisations and human rights forums. The 70 representatives are to join the agitation in Kolkata after their arrival on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, a different group of protesting teachers earlier this week reportedly went to Sourav Ganguly’s Kolkata residence to invite the cricketer to their protest on April 21. However, they were stopped and detained by personnel of Thakurpukur Police Station and asked to drop off the invitation at Mr Ganguly’s office instead.",

    "content": "Even as numerous Opposition parties have made charges of voter roll manipulations, there have been hardly any appeals filed by them on inclusion or exclusion of voters after publication of Special Summary Electoral Rolls.\n\nAs per reports filed by Chief Electoral Officers (CEO) of 36 States and Union Territories, accessed by The Hindu, there have been 89 primary appeals and only one final appeal made before the Maharashtra Assembly polls. Since the Lok Sabha elections held in 2024 and till after the final publication of SSR on January 7 this year, no other appeal had been made by any political party in any other State.\n\n​Double trouble: On elections, the EPIC number and the voter\n\nThe reports filed by the CEOs take in to consideration the countrywide Special Summary Revision (SSR) of Electoral Rolls in nearly 10.5 Lakh Polling Booths and in all 4,123 Assembly Constituencies of the country. It also includes the SSR which was specifically done for States/ UTs that went for assembly elections after Lok Sabha election in 2024, including Maharashtra, Haryana and Delhi.\n\nThe electoral roll is in a state of continuous updation throughout the year, except during an election in a constituency for a period from the last date of filing nominations to completion of the election process. With an amendment made in the Representation of the People Act 1950, four qualifying dates i.e., January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 have come into effect in a calendar year in place of one qualifying date of January 1. However, the Annual Summary Revision with all pre-revision activities is conducted with reference to January 1 of the year only, in which the roll is finally published, as qualifying date.\n\nSection 24 of the Representation of People Act, 1961, says appeals contesting inclusion or exclusion of names in electoral rolls can first be filed with the District Magistrate and then with the Chief Electoral Officers. As per Rule 27 of the Registration of Electors Rules, 1960, the first appeal to DM can be filed within 15 days of the order of ERO and the second appeal to CEO can be filed within 30 days of the order of DM. However, the delay in filing appeal can be condoned by DM and/or CEO as per the proviso of Rule 27.\n\nEver since the Maharashtra Assembly poll results brought the BJP-led Maha Yuti back to power, the Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi has been claiming that the there was an unnaturally large number of people added to the list in five months since the Lok Sabha polls. Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi had claimed that 39 lakh names were added to the rolls before the Assembly elections, which was equivalent to the voting population of a State like Himachal Pradesh.\n\nMore recently, the Trinamool Congress had made public a list of duplicate voter IDs or EPIC numbers prompting the Election Commission to say that the matter would be redressed within a period of three months.\n\nThe Opposition parties had, however, intensified their attack on the panel. They alleged that the ECI’s defence that duplicate IDs exist in different States, showed its “complicity” in voter “manipulation”.\n\nTo assuage concerns regarding electoral practices and rules, the ECI has last month also initiated meetings at the grassroots level with political parties across the country on all pending issues, including updation of electoral rolls.\n\nNearly 5,000 such meetings have been held so far through this engagement drive, the ECI’s biggest so far. The commission met over 28,000 representatives of political parties. The poll body is also holding training of Booth Level Agents (BLA) of political parties in poll-bound states like Bihar.",

    "content": "In a significant initiative aimed at providing a hassle-free travel experience for passengers, Southern Railway on Saturday (April 19, 2025) introduced the first air-conditioned EMU (Electric Multiple Unit) train service in Chennai, on the Chennai Beach-Chengalpattu section. While the minimum fare is fixed at ₹35, passengers will have to pay ₹85 to travel from Chennai Beach to Tambaram and ₹105 to Chengalpattu.\n\nThe AC EMU service was first introduced in the Mumbai suburban railway, which has witnessed steady patronage among commuters, particularly office-goers and women. The Chennai Beach-Chengalpattu section of the Chennai suburban railway sees high footfall, and the AC EMU service will be a boon for commuters during peak hours and in the hot and humid weather.\n\nThe modern AC EMU rake, equipped with better facilities for passengers, including automatic doors, passenger information systems, CCTV cameras, and well-marked entry/exit points, is a milestone in enhancing passenger comfort, Southern Railway said.\n\nTrain timings\n\nThe first AC EMU train chugged out from Chennai Beach at 7:05 a.m. on Saturday, reaching Tambaram at 7:42 a.m. and Chengalpattu at 8:35 a.m. In the return direction, it departed from Chengalpattu at 9 a.m. and reached Chennai Beach at 10 a.m.\n\nIn the evening, the train departs from Chennai Beach at 3:45 p.m. and arrives at Chengalpattu at 5:25 p.m. While returning, it leaves Chengalpattu at 5:45 p.m. and reaches Chennai Beach at 7:15 p.m.\n\nThe Tambaram-Chennai Beach-Tambaram air-conditioned EMU service has also commenced. It will depart at 5:45 a.m. from Tambaram and reach Chennai Beach at 6:45 a.m. In the evening, the train departs from Chennai Beach at 7:35 p.m. and reaches Tambaram at 8:35 p.m. Both services are operated in both directions.\n\n‘A welcome move’\n\nWhile many commuters welcomed the new service, there are also demands to increase the frequency of the service and reduce the fare.\n\nK. Shankar Babu, former staffer of Integral Coach Factory (ICF) and a commuter, said, when the first air-conditioned units were manufactured in ICF a few years ago, their rakes had gone to Central and Western Railways. This is the first time the Southern Railway has been allotted air-conditioned rakes. Following feedback from users from those railways, new features have also been added now, he said.\n\n“This AC EMU is quite convenient and comfortable for local commuters. If the railway administration changes the pattern of the timings, which suits office-goers, it will see more patronage. The fare is also reasonable since more facilities, such as CCTVs and fire alarms, have been added.”\n\nR.V. Ragunathan, who takes the EMU from Perungalathur to Beach regularly, said: “We are fascinated by the new service. In the last 25 years, I have been travelling in the first class in the EMU train, and it is overcrowded during peak hours. The new AC service will offer comfortable travel.” Mohammed Yasif Khan, on the other hand, said he prefers travelling in the Metro rail, and believes it can be a gamechanger for passengers in the summer season.\n\nAadhesh, a Purasawakkam resident, said: “We have been demanding this [service] for the past three months. It is finally here, and we expect an increase in frequency of services soon.” Suresh Gagariya of Purasawalkam suggests improving the seat upholstery to make the experience more wholesome.\n\nArva, a schoolteacher who travels from Egmore to Tambaram, said: “If they reduce the fare a little, it may be useful for passengers like me.”\n\nThe inaugural service did not attract crowds, but since it was a Saturday, this was believed to be par for the course, according to railway officials. They added that weekday services are likely to attract more passengers.",

Over the past months, there have been repeated and deeply disturbing instances of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh, from desecration of Hindu temples to targeted attacks on the homes and businesses of minorities. This pattern of intimidation and brutality cannot be ignored,” he said.\n\nCalling on the Indian government to take action, the Congress MP said, “We reiterate our demand that the safety, dignity, and rights of religious minorities in Bangladesh be protected in letter and spirit. Silence and inaction are not options when such targeted violence is allowed to take root.”\n\n“The Indian National Congress stands in solidarity with the Hindu community in Bangladesh and with all those who believe in secularism, justice, and human rights,” Mr. Ramesh said.\n\nMeanwhile, the post-mortem of Hindu community leader Bhavesh Chandra Roy, who was allegedly abducted from his home and beaten to death earlier this week in Dinajpur district’s Biral upazila, has been completed, police confirmed on Saturday. (April 19,20254).\n\nRoy, a resident of Basudebpur village under Shatagram Union, served as the vice-president of the Biral unit of the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad and was a respected figure in the local Hindu community.",

    "content": "When judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts have the authority to declare laws passed by Parliament or State Legislatures unconstitutional, they would also have the power to issue directions to constitutional authorities such as the President and Governors to perform public functions, said former Supreme Court judge Jasti Chelameswar in Chennai on Saturday (April 19, 2025).\n\nHe was responding to a question posed by retired Madras High Court judge C.T. Selvam, after delivering a lecture on ‘The 75-year journey of the Constitution of India’, organised by Rakesh Law Foundation (RLF) in association with Rojah Muthiah Research Library (RMRL), celebrating the 24th birth anniversary of Rakesh Ranganathan, son of senior advocate and DMK Rajya Sabha member N.R. Elango.\n\nReferring to Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar’s recent outburst against the Supreme Court having prescribed a timeline of three months for the President to act upon Bills referred by the Governors, he said: “If you and I, as judges, can declare a law made by Parliament unconstitutional, to believe that they have no power to direct a public office holder to do a public act, to my mind, would be constitutionally doubtful, because I will not subscribe to that theory.”\n\nEarlier, in his lecture, Mr. Chelameswar said, the completion of 75 years since the Constitution came into force in the country must be taken as an opportunity to introspect than celebrate. He said that the more than 100 amendments made to the Constitution over the last 75 years, the “insane amount of money” spent by candidates to win elections, and the mounting arrears caused by insufficient budgetary allocation for the judiciary were all matters of concern.\n\nJustice G.R. Swaminathan of the Madras High Court; N. Ravi, Director, Kasturi and Sons; and P.K. Sekarbabu, Tamil Nadu Minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, participated in the event. Retired Madras High Court judge G.M. Akbar Ali moderated the interaction. RMRL director G. Sundar, RLF vice chairperson Ragavi Elango, treasurer Stalin Abhimanyu, and assistant treasurer M. Ranjith also spoke.",

The leader said he would not like to continue in the post “when a person, who could not stomach my elevation in the party, derived pleasure in creating a bad name for the party and its leadership in the last four years.”\n\n“I will participate in the administrative committee meeting of the party on April 20, and after that, I will not participate in any meeting that will involve taking important decisions,” said Mr. Durai Vaiko, who is the son of party founder Vaiko.\n\nThough he has not named the person responsible for his decision to step down from the principal secretary post, party sources said there was a difference of opinion between Mr. Durai Vaiko and MDMK general secretary Mallai Sathya.\n\nMr. Durai Vaiko, despite Mr. Vaiko’s resistance and objection, was first appointed as the headquarters secretary, before his elevation as the principal secretary. He had the backing of 104 out of the 106 general administrative council members.\n\nIn a statement issued on Saturday, Mr. Durai Vaiko said he took the decision to quit the party post to ensure that neither the party nor its founding father (Vaiko) suffers any damage to their reputation.\n\n“I will continue to function as a prominent cadre of the party and remain a comrade of the partymen and office-bearers. I will also perform my duty as the member of the Tiruchi Lok Sabha for the benefit of the people of the constituency,” he said.\n\nHe called upon the office-bearers of the party to continue the work carried out by him in the last seven years and protect Mr. Vaiko from being hurt, as he had “suffered a lot in politics already.”",

    "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bescom-records-single-digit-distribution-losses-two-years-in-a-row-bengaluru/article69461506.ece",
    "content": "The power utilities in Karnataka have been trying hard to reduce their distribution losses for many years. The Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom), which is responsible for almost 50% of the State’s distribution, incurred distribution losses of 9.13% in the financial year (FY) 2023–24.\n\nFor quite a few years, the distribution losses of Bescom were around 11%, attracting a lot of flak towards the company by the consumers. In FY 2021–22, it was 11.63% while in the FY 2020–21, it was 11.99%. Interestingly, in FY 2022–23, the distribution loss went down to single digit (9.71%). The trend continued in 2023–24 (9.13%).\n\nBescom attributes this dip to reduced power interruptions. “We have cut down on power interruptions. Our two projects of aerial bunched cables (ABC) and underground (UG) cables are almost 100% complete. This has helped us in increasing our reliability and, thereby, cut down on our distribution losses,” said a senior official from the Energy Audit Department of Bescom.\n\nKERC approved loss percentage\n\nThe multiple year tariff order recently issued by the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC), approved distribution losses of 9.65% for FY 2025 – 26, of 9.40% for FY 2026 – 27, and 9.15% for FY 2027 – 28. If the losses are less than this, it attracts incentives to the company while exceeding these targets will attract penalties.\n\nTo reduce the loss further, KERC directed all the escoms to identify the high loss sub-divisions or divisions, and prioritise the capex specifically to reduce them. It further asked them to improve the reliability of the distribution system and improve voltage regulations.\n\nThe commission added, “Furthermore, the commission has observed that energy audit reports of cities and towns, complete with detailed analysis, are not being submitted regularly. Escoms are required to conduct energy audits of identified cities and towns. Based on the audit results, initiate necessary actions to reduce distribution losses, and improve collection efficiency, aimed at achieving targeted loss levels of less than 15% in all towns.\n\n“It has been noted that several towns and cities show abnormally higher energy losses. Escoms are directed to prioritise these areas and implement corrective measures to reduce losses. Escoms are directed to conduct the energy audit and submit compliance reports quarterly to the Commission, without fail.”\n\nConsumers still unhappy\n\nWhile Bescom has managed to bring down the distribution losses, consumers are still not happy with the progress.\n\n“According to international standards, distribution losses should be less than 5%, especially since there are UG cables now. These reductions are otherwise of no use to consumers, as there is no accountability for the power that is lost,” said M. G. Prabhakar, former member of the KERC advisory committee.",

    "content": "The U.S. government on Saturday (April 19, 2025) denied targeting Indians specifically amongst thousands of student visa revocations after a survey found 50% of those reporting the revocations were Indian. While the Ministry of External Affairs hasn’t confirmed whether growing concerns over the future for Indian students affected by the revocations will be raised with U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and senior U.S. State Department officials arriving in Delhi on Monday (April 21, 2025), the issue could cause some awkward moments during the visit.\n\nThe survey, conducted by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) studied 327 responses to a research call, out of an estimated more than 4,000 revocation notices sent out in the last two months, and found half had gone to Indians. The study was described in a policy brief that found “50% of these students were from India, followed by 14% from China,” adding that other significant countries in the data included South Korea, Nepal, and Bangladesh.\n\nWhen asked about the report, and the indication that Indians were particularly targeted for the revocation of the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme (SEVIS) status, an American official, who asked not to be named, denied the process was discriminatory against Indians.\n\n“Continuous vetting and visa revocation actions are not limited to visa holders from any specific country or area in the world. All visa applicants and visa holders, no matter the visa type and where they are located, are continuously vetted,” the official told The Hindu in a written response.\n\nThe rapid increase in SEVIS terminations came after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio launched a new AI-assisted “Catch and Revoke” program that would identify students believed to have political views inimical to U.S. Foreign policy interests based on their social media posts. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security is carrying out a nationwide crackdown on students whose names allegedly feature in police databases, and terminating their student status due to visa violations according to US immigration laws.\n\nTwo Indian researchers, Ranjani Srinivasan and Badar Khan Suri were among the first batch of students detained or told to “self-deport” in the first round of such notices, where the MEA had cautioned Indian students to “follow the law” . Subsequently, a number of Indian students have approached courts to have their SEVIS status restored, and in an indication of a shift in the MEA’s stance, Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal disclosed this week that the Indian embassy and missions are “in touch” with affected students and were offering support.\n\nThe AILA study found many of those whose visa has been revoked had been in police reports for minor traffic violations or campus infractions, while in an extreme case, a student who was a victim of domestic abuse had their visa cancelled because their name appeared in the police complaint. Only 2 of the 327 responses received pertained to allegations that the students were involved in any political activity, and lawyers have pointed out that protesting is not illegal per se, and that the students risked losing their futures due to the government’s action.\n\n“International students contribute billions of dollars to [the U.S.] economy. Scholars and researchers are making this country stronger by doing incredibly valuable work in cancer research, space travel, computer technology and almost every area of science and research. Driving them elsewhere not only weakens our economy but threatens our national security,” AILA Executive Director Ben Johnson said.\n\nThe MEA declined to comment on whether the issue would be raised directly with Mr. Vance, or other officials like US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Ricky Gill who will be in Delhi on April 21 for official meetings. Mr. Vance, who is accompanied by his family is expected to be hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n“The discussions held during that meeting (between Mr. Modi and Mr. Vance) will cover all bilateral issues between India and the United States,” Mr. Jaiswal said on Friday, without elaborating on whether U.S. tariffs or other specific problems would be on the agenda. Mr. Vance will travel next to Jaipur and Agra while State Department officials will attend an India-U.S. forum hosted by the MEA and organised by the Ananta Centre.",

    "content": "Kerala’s Leader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan has accused the Excise and the police of “finding an easy target in hapless and vulnerable drug addicts instead of netting the big fish in the narcotic trade.”\n\nHe told a news conference at Aluva in Ernakulam on Saturday that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s “much-hyped” anti-narcotics enforcement drive had “missed the forest for the trees.”\n\nMr Satheesan commented against the backdrop of the police summons to actor Shine Tom Chacko after the latter absconded from a hotel in Kochi during an anti-narcotic raid recently.\n\nMr Satheesan said drug addicts required sympathetic counselling, de-addiction and rehabilitation. “Currently, officers find easy targets in people with an addiction who relapse into their old ways when released on bail from prison. The sad cycle keeps repeating while the real traffickers walk free”, he said.\n\nMr Satheesan accused the government of dismally failing to squeeze narcotic supply chains, chiefly transnational networks which inject potentially lethal synthetic drugs into domestic circulation in Kerala.\n\nInstead, he alleged that the government relied on propaganda and publicity campaigns to create an impression that law enforcement was serious about saving the people from the synthetic drug menace.\n\nActionable intelligence\n\nMr Satheesan said law enforcers find it convenient to visit schools and colleges and make highfalutin speeches about the drug menace.\n\nInstead, he said, they should devote themselves to the time-consuming, risky and uphill task of developing actionable intelligence by infiltrating entrenched networks and interdicting drugs trafficked in trade quantities.\n\nMr Satheesan said the police and the Excise “seek cover” behind awareness campaigns and administering anti-narcotic oaths in public to create an appearance of cracking down on narcotics.\n\nMr Satheesan said law enforcers should leave such tasks to social and political organisations and the Health, Social Welfare, and Education departments.\n\nHe said synthetic drugs appeared to have pervaded all walks of life in the State, and the entertainment industry was no exception.\n\nHe said drugs were freely available even in the remotest part of Kerala. A significant section of the population, especially teenagers and school students, was particularly vulnerable to the drug menace.\n\nMr Satheesan also accused the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] of providing political cover to gangs involved in drug trafficking.",

    "content": "The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition in Kerala will boycott the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s fourth-anniversary celebrations.\n\nThe UDF will launch a parallel campaign to counter the LDF’s “publicity blitz at taxpayers’ expenses.” It has urged Lok Sabha members, legislators, and local body representatives not to attend any government function except those concerning development in their respective constituencies.\n\nLeader of the Opposition V.D. Satheesan told a press conference on Saturday that the LDF was “vacuuming the State’s depleted treasury for political campaigning” ahead of the local body this year polls and the 2026 Assembly elections.\n\nHe said the LDF’s “profligacy knew no limits.” It has earmarked ₹15 crore for giant hoardings featuring Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, he pointed out.\n\n“The spending is just the tip of the iceberg. The LDF is pouring public money into a publicity blitz aimed at glossing over its dismal administrative failures, development stasis, scandals involving the Chief Minister’s Office and the government’s abandonment of the working classes,” he said.\n\n‘Self-inflicted financial exigency’\n\nMr. Satheesan unleashed a litany of complaints against the government. He said two consecutive LDF governments had pushed the State into deep debt, and financial mismanagement, lack of thrift, and dismal tax administration had exacerbated the economic crisis.\n\n“The self-inflicted financial exigency has manifested in a lack of medicines in hospitals. Workers could not cash in on their welfare fund board investments. The Karunya medical insurance scheme has come to a halt”, he said.\n\nThe government’s market intervention policies have failed to curb seller inflation. It owed Supplyco vendors significant amounts of money. Surcharges on fuel, power, and water and the unjustified hike in revenue fees have aggravated the living crisis. Civic works have halted due to the inability to pay public works contractors, he added.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Satheesan said the LDF had no compunction about spending money on salaries for political appointees in various boards and the Public Service Commission (PSC).\n\nMr. Satheesan said wild animal raids on farmlands have crippled the rural economy. The price of cash crops has plummeted. “The government has no money to hike the minimum support price of rubber and coconut. Paddy procurement has stopped. There is no government. Mr. Vijayan has pushed Kerala into a downward spiral of decline,” he added.",

    "content": "Citing lack of transparency and alleged disparity between exam shifts doctors have approached the Union Health Ministry seeking urgent intervention and revision of the move to conduct this year’s National Eligibility-Entrance Test for Postgraduate (NEET-PG) exam in double shift.\n\nThe National Board of Examination in Medical Sciences (NBEMS) announced that it would conduct NEET PG 2025 in two shifts on June 15, 2025. While the first shift is scheduled from 9:00 AM to 12:30 PM, the second shift is scheduled from 3:30 PM to 7:00 PM.\n\nIn their letter to the Health Ministry doctors under the Indian Medical Association Junior Doctors’ Network (IMA-JDN) said that the decision to hold NEET PG 2024 in double shifts was taken citing lack of sufficient time to allocate the centres and ensure security protocols -- “no such problem exists this year,’’ they said.\n\nDoctors also pointed out last year even though NBEMS and the National Medical Council (NMC) brought in a normalisation process after doctors pointed out disparity between shifts the process was flawed.\n\nReferring to the PG medical entrance exam held last year, IMA-JDN said that in NEET PG 2024 there were allegations regarding the disparity between the two shifts of the exam. “The primary issue with the two-shift model is the lack of transparency in the normalisation process. Last year, it was widely observed that Shift 2 was significantly more difficult, leading to disparities in scores and relative rankings. This not only affected the performance of deserving candidates but also created a sense of uncertainty and demoralisation,” the group noted in its letter.\n\nNational secretary of IMA-JDN standing committee, Indranil Deshmukh, explained there is serious concern for the 2 lakhs NEET-PG aspirants who may be subjected to the same issues as last year.\n\n“NEET-PG 2025 is again being held in two shifts, despite the absence of any logistical urgency this year. The lack of transparency in the normalisation process, unequal difficulty levels across shifts, and denial of access to answer keys and response sheets have raised genuine concerns among candidates regarding the fairness of the process. We urge the authorities to consider conducting the exam in a single shift, ensure transparency in score calculation, and expand centres to all districts. A just and transparent process is essential to uphold the credibility of medical education and protect the aspirations of our young doctors,” said Dr. Deshmukh.\n\nDoctors add that the reasons given to hold NEET-PG 2024 in two shifts last year included lack of sufficient time for centre allocation and ensuring security protocols, especially when the exam was rescheduled and over 2 lakh doctors were involved. “However, in the current year, there has been no such logistical constraint or last-minute change, and yet the exam is scheduled in two shifts—raising genuine concerns among aspirants,” the doctors noted, warning that these actions diminish the credibility of the examination process.\n\nA few candidates who appeared in the second shift of the NEET PG 2024 exam had questioned the normalization formula adopted by NBEMS and further claimed that the board had scammed them in the name of a competitive exam. They pointed out that the Shift 2 paper was tougher compared to Shift 1 and further termed the process of calculating scores as debatable. These concerns were also raised before the Supreme Court, where the aspirants sought transparency in the NEET PG 2024 exam.",

    "content": "Actor Shine Tom Chacko appeared before the Kochi City police in Kerala around 10 a.m. on Saturday (April 19, 2025). He turned up at the Ernakulam Town North police station after the police had summoned him to appear for questioning in connection with an incident in which he allegedly fled a hotel at Kaloor in Kochi city during a raid by the District Anti-Narcotics Special Action Force (DANSAF) late on Wednesday night. The actor, however, declined to speak to the large posse of media that had gathered in front of the police station.\n\nReportedly, the police have prepared a detailed questionnaire of 30-odd questions, including why he fled upon seeing the police team. The police have also collected his call record data over the last month, it is learnt. The Narcotics Cell Assistant Commissioner is also present at the station.\n\nSince the incident, Mr. Chacko had been incommunicado except for his social media posts. The police served the notice summoning him to appear for questioning at his residence in Kochi city.\n\nCCTV footage\n\nThe police have also collected CCTV footage of Mr. Chacko fleeing the hotel at Kaloor. Allegedly, he fled his room on the third floor through the window by jumping onto the asbestos sheet of the second floor. He allegedly crossed the swimming pool area, took the stairs to the reception area, and fled riding pillion on a two-wheeler.\n\nReportedly, the DANSAF team arrived at the hotel after receiving a tip-off about a drug peddler. They came to know about Mr. Chacko’s presence in the hotel through the register and chose to knock on his door.\n\nThough there was no response initially, another person opened the door. The police, however, failed to recover any narcotic substances from the room despite a thorough search.\n\nRecently, actor Vincy Aloshious had filed formal complaints with the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) of a film she had worked in and the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) reportedly naming Mr. Chacko. This came a few days after she had raised allegations of drug use and misbehaviour by a male co-star on a film set.\n\nMr. Chacko was recently acquitted in a drug case by the Ernakulam Additional Sessions Court, citing procedural lapses on the part of the police during the drug seizure and his arrest in 2015.",

Those who praise these people insult Indian Muslims,” said Mr. Singh.\n\nHe further alleged “post-Independence historians with Left leanings” are not giving due credit to Rana Pratap and Chhatrapati Shivaji but eulosgised Aurangzeb,\n\n“Those who feel that Aurangzeb was a hero should have read Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who wrote that the Mughal emperor was a bigot, cruel ruler,” he said. “Dara Shikoh translated Upanishads, and Aurangzeb murdered him. Dara Shikoh respected all religions,” Mr. Singh added.\n\nMaharana Pratap sacrificed his life to uphold his self-respect and challenged the dominance of Mughal Emperor Akbar, Mr. Singh said. “Adivasis [tribals] and Muslims were part of his army. Hakim Khan Suri sacrificed his life in the battle of Haldighati, fighting against the Mughals.

    "content": "Renovation of ancient structures using modern technology and materials without denting their aesthetics and historical value has always been a challenge. And when the structure is a temple as old as the Srikalahastheeswara Swamy Devasthanam in Srikalahasti town of Tirupati district, there is no room for error.\n\nThe temple had been facing leaks at several spots on its roof for a long time, despite the application of concrete over the years. However, the temple management’s latest efforts, which blend age-old practices with modern technology, promise a lasting solution that also keeps the temple’s authentic beauty intact.\n\nA fascinating origin\n\nSrikalahastheeswara Swamy temple is a famous Saivite shrine revered as ‘Dakshina Kashi’ (southern Kashi). People from south, who find it difficult to visit the ancient town of Kashi on the banks of the Ganga river, offer prayers at this shrine. It is said that a visit to this temple is equal to that to the Kashi Vishwanath Mandir.\n\nMythology has it that the Shiva Linga here was initially worshipped by Sri (spider), Kala (serpent) and Hasti (elephant), hence the name. Moreover, the story of Bhakta Kannappa, a devotee from the Chenchu tribe who offered his eyes to Lord Shiva, is equally popular among the masses.\n\nThe ancient shrine was re-built and developed over the centuries by various kings. Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty constructed the main structure in the 11th century. Temple inscriptions also mention the contributions of Rajaditya Chola, Rajaraja Chola and Kulothunga Chola among others to this shrine.\n\nThe hundred-pillar mandapam, considered a sight to behold with its ornate carvings, was built by Vijayanagara Emperor Sri Krishna Devaraya in 1516. It was during the same period that the ‘Raja Gopuram’ (the 120 feet tower at the entrance) was built. It collapsed in May 2010 but was rebuilt in its original form on the same spot and consecrated in 2017.\n\nThe problem\n\nThe temple structure has a massive common roof spread over 64,000 sq.ft., covering the sanctum sanctorum of Sri Swamivaru as well as Ammavaru, besides the other celestial beings (Parivara Devathalu).\n\nAn ancient roof of brick and surkhi (burnt clay) mortar is kept aloft by stone slabs. When it rained, water seeped into the temple through pillar joints and gaps in the roof stones. The issue was addressed for the first time in 2009, when a chemical coating was applied to arrest the leakages, but in vain.\n\nIn 2014, the whole roof, except the Ammavari temple, was given a chemical coating, but the leaks reappeared after a year or two. A similar process was undertaken in 2018, with the Endowments Commissioner ordering the application of two varieties of chemicals on a trial basis. Accordingly, Major leak points above Sikhara Darshan, the corridor from Vahana Mandapam to Nataraja Swamy Sannidhi and the corridor from Swamivari Sannidhi to Yagasala, were treated during 2018-19; this, too, turned out to be ineffective in a few years.\n\nSinged by the setbacks, the temple management consulted experts to come up with an out-of-the-box solution.\n\nThe Study\n\nIndian Institute of Technology Tirupati (IIT-T), located 20 km from the temple, offered to provide a solution. IIT-T director K.N. Satyanarayana visited the temple in October 2021, along with professors C.V.R. Murthy and Arun Menon (both from IIT-Madras), B. Balakrishna and Prasanna Kumar Behera, both assistant professors from IIT-T.\n\nArchaeological Survey of India (ASI) director (Epigraphy) K. Munirathnam Reddy was also roped in for consultations pertaining to maintaining the heritage structure in its original form. He was also instrumental in convincing the sponsor Uttara Devi Charitable Trust headed by B. Venkateswara Rao of VH Group, Pune, to meet the project cost of ₹5 crore.\n\nThe team suggested core cutting to understand the strata details of the Surkhi mortar at select points on the roof. The samples taken were sent to a laboratory in IIT-Madras.\n\nThe samples showed at least five layers of brick with lime mortar joints. As the thermal behaviour of plain cement concrete (PCC) and lime mortar are fundamentally different, the overlay of concrete over the ancient roofing led to the cracks. This was aggravated by the rusted chicken-wire mesh in the top layer of concrete. Cracks in the PCC layer led to significant rainwater seepage, which was absorbed by the brick layers.\n\nBefore the work began, the expert team visited ancient temples in Tamil Nadu, especially those built during the Pallava and Chola eras, to understand the complexity of stone structures, especially the joints, and to replicate the age-old technical practices to ensure authenticity.\n\nFor a pilot, the team selected the roof above the shrine of Goddess Gnana Prasunambika Devi. The concrete layer was removed and the depleted brick jelly lime concrete (BJLC), was proposed to be redone using a mixture made out of jaggery, Kadukkai (hirda) extract, Arabic tree gum, lady’s finger, jute and urad dal.\n\nSufficient gradient was proposed to prevent rainwater stagnation. “Measures were taken to provide PVC pipes every 30 sq.m. of roof area and grating to filter the dry leaves and debris to avoid clogging of the pipes,” says T. Bapi Reddy, Executive Officer of Srikalahastheeswara Swamy Devasthanam.\n\nHow it was done\n\nThe concrete overlay was removed by hand, without using any power tools, so as to protect the stone slabs underneath. A fresh weathering course BJLC, compatible with historic material of the roof, was applied after the removal of all the loose and damaged bricks and mortar.\n\n“The BJLC was prepared by crushing jaggery and Kadukkai and mixing them in water, and this solution was added to lime and sand,” says ASI Director (Epigraphy) Dr. Muniratnam Reddy, adding that the consistency of the solution depended on the concentration of jaggery and Kadukkai and that it acted as a binding material of sort when added to lime and sand.\n\nThe ideal ratio is 4% jaggery and 2.5% Kadukkai to every litre of water. The solution, fermented for fifteen days, was mixed with lime mortar and injected between the damaged brick layers to strengthen them.\n\nWhat the experts say\n\nThe expert panel that inspected the ancient structure made a few significant observations regarding the preservation of stone structures.\n\nA major issue, according to the panel, is the current practice of using of cement mortar on vertical stone walls to arrest leaks. This should be avoided as it could damage the stone over time owing to the incompatible stiffness and strength of cement mortar. The experts suggest lime mortar as a better alternative.\n\nThey also observed that many temple managements resort to ad hoc solutions such as sand blasting. Such a step not only damages the beauty of the stone, but also damage any historical inscriptions the stone may have, making them incomprehensible.\n\nAnother issue noted by the experts is the drilling of holes on to stone structures for lighting and other fixtures such as air-conditioning ducting, public address system, security cameras and fire-fighting equipment, to which the Srikalahasti temple was no exception. The experts suggested removal of the air-conditioning outdoor units from the terrace and instead have a centralised AC system away from the historical structures.\n\nProject Srikalahasti took fourteen months to complete, and the experts involved in the project say the structure will last for the next 500 years, with its architectural grandeur intact.",

The ruling and opposition parties tried to score political points over the issue, putting the reputation of the TTD at stake.\n\nFIR filed\n\nThe SVU Campus Police —the limits under which the dairy farm falls—filed an FIR on Friday, based on a complaint lodged by BJP spokesperson and TTD Trust Board member G. Bhanuprakash Reddy. He submitted a copy of the complaint to Tirupati Superintendent of Police V. Harshavardhan Raju recently.\n\nThe FIR accused TTD former Chairman Bhumana Karunakar Reddy of ‘deliberately spreading misinformation’, thus invoking Sections 353 (1), 299 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita and Section 74 IT Act 2000-2008.\n\nReferring to the ‘wild allegations’ made by Mr. Karunakar Reddy, Mr. Bhanuprakash Reddy warned the political parties not to defame the TTD by levelling such ‘baseless allegations with a malicious intent’.\n\nBhumana retorts\n\nIn response, Mr. Karunakar Reddy said he would not be cowed down by such attempts to muzzle his freedom of expressing the truth.\n\n“Even if 100 cases are filed against me, I will not be scared by the misrule of the NDA government. I stand by my word and am ready to prove their misdeeds,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, CPI national secretary K. Narayana called for a halt to the allegations and counter-allegations on the issue by the ruling dispensation and the Opposition.\n\nConditions at farm satisfactory: CPI\n\nMr. Narayana visited the dairy farm a few days ago and found the fodder supply and hygienic conditions as ‘satisfactory’.\n\nAt a media conference on Friday, Mr. Narayana condemned the attempts to score political points over the issues concerning religious sentiments.\n\nReferring to the ‘high drama’ enacted by both the sides, house arrest, protests, etc., he said it was unfortunate that the parties were dragging the dairy farm issue to the streets.\n\nMeanwhile, the TTD has released the number of deaths of cows reported at the dairy farm in the 2024-25 financial year. The deaths counts are as follows: 17 (April 2024), 18 (May 2024), 13 (June 2024), 18 (July 2024), 15 (August 2024), 21 (Sep 2024), 19 (Oct 2024), 13 (Nov 2024), 14 (Dec 2024), 18 (Jan 2025), 13 (Feb 2025) and 12 (Mar 2025).",

    "content": "Andhra Pradesh Chief Secretary K. Vijayanand has said that 55 transmission projects including the augmentation of ICT capacity and installation of additional bus reactors for reactive power management, worth ₹4,965 crore are in various stages of execution and poised to be commissioned in 2025-26 and over the next two financial years.\n\n“These projects represent a phased and strategic expansion of the State’s transmission infrastructure aimed at improving grid reliability and operational efficiency,” Mr. Vijayanand, who is also the Special Chief Secretary (Energy), said in a review meeting on AP-Transco’s major infrastructure works in Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and Kadapa zones, on Friday.\n\nHe said 18 transmission projects costing ₹1,095 crore have been successfully commissioned, and these projects play a vital role in enhancing the system capacity for power evacuation and meeting the rising energy demand.\n\nAP-Transco has recently placed orders for nearly 10 major projects costing ₹3,407 crore, including the diversion of 400 KV and 220 KV lines within the capital region. Besides, tenders are being floated for 47 works worth ₹5,323 crore under various government schemes, he said.\n\nThe AP-Transco is in the process of integrating advanced technologies such as SCADA systems and automation across substations to modernise its infrastructure and these upgrades are intended to enhance real-time monitoring, improve efficiency and minimize energy losses, he said.\n\nGrowing consumption\n\nThe State power utility is gearing up to meet the growing daily consumption, which is expected to reach 260 Million Units (MU) in the coming months. The AP-Transco is aligning its operations with the broader energy vision of the State government, with a focus on delivering quality infrastructure, minimising transmission losses, and ensuring uninterrupted power supply, Mr. Vijayanand added.\n\nAP-Transco Joint MD Kirthi Chekuri, Director (Grid) A.K.V.

    "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-top-courts-definition-of-woman-further-polarises-debate-on-gender/article69464919.ece",
    "content": "On April 16, the U.K.’s Supreme Court unanimously ruled that only biological women and not transwomen meet the definition of a woman under equality laws. The central question in For Women Scotland Ltd. (Appellant) vs The Scottish Ministers (Respondent) was “whether the Equality Act 2010 treats a transwoman with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) as a woman for all purposes within the scope of its provisions, or when that Act speaks of a ‘woman’ and ‘sex’, it is referring to a biological woman and biological sex”.\n\nThe ruling\n\nIn an 88-page judgment, the five judges – three men (Lord Reed, President Lord Hodge, Deputy President Lord Lloyd-Jones) and two women (Lady Rose, Lady Simler) – held that they wanted to address the “meaning of the words” which Parliament used in EA 2010 in “legislating to protect women and members of the trans community against discrimination.” It said that among the people whom the EA 2010 recognises as having protected characteristics are women, whose “protected” characteristic is sex, and “transsexual” people, whose “protected” characteristic is gender reassignment. After hearing both the appellant and the respondent, and experts and activists, Britain’s highest court gave its “statutory interpretation” that the terms ‘woman’ and ‘sex’ in the EA 2010 refer only to a biological woman and biological sex.\n\nTrans rights\n\nTrans supporters and campaigners worry that the ruling is a setback for trans inclusion. Jane Fae, director of the campaign group TransActual, told The Guardian, that the ruling had stripped away protections for trans people to the “bare minimum, by reducing the legal protections only to cases involving harassment, discrimination or equal pay”. Kishwer Falkner, the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), added to the fears of the trans community by saying that the court’s judgment meant only “biological women could use single-sex changing rooms and women’s toilets, or participate in women-only sporting events and teams, or be placed in women’s wards in hospitals.” Many trans people who have undergone gender reassignment admit that the toilet issue — should transwomen be allowed in women-only spaces? — needs to be sorted out. The judges counselled against reading the judgment as a triumph for one or more groups in society at the expense of another —“it is not,” Justice Hodge told the media. The judges are of the view that the Gender Recognition Act 2004 continues to provide legal recognition of the rights of transgender people, which has practical effects for individual rights and freedoms “(including, for example, in the context of marriage, pensions, retirement and social security).” Transgender people, the ruling noted, are also protected by the indirect discrimination provisions of the EA 2010 “without the need for a certificated sex reading of the EA 2010”.\n\nGender laws\n\nThe movement to change transgender laws has ebbed in Scotland after the exit of Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon. She suddenly resigned in 2023, but not before getting a lot of criticism for her plans to change gender laws so that those with gender recognition certificates could be entitled to the same protections as biological women. The Scottish government said it accepted the judgment and protection of rights of all groups would underpin future moves. For Women Scotland, who appealed against the Scottish government’s plans, said it was vindicated because it had argued that only biological women should be entitled to rights for women.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Commission uses the term ‘transgender’ as an umbrella term to describe people whose sense of their own gender is different to their sex at birth. Human rights abuses against transgender people include violence, discrimination (the hijra community in India is ghettoised and struggles to get health care or education or housing), lack of legal recognition of their identity and harassment. Trans people are often branded as ill, “pathologised”, but being different, says the UN, should not be treated as a disorder. The UN has highlighted that pathologisation is one of the root causes of human rights violations faced by trans people.\n\nIn countries around the world, there has been an increasing decimation of rights for people who do not fit into the binary of male and female. In Hungary, for example, a wider crackdown on the LGBTQIA+ community impacted transgender people with the government stating that there are two sexes, male and female, and that legal norms are based on “biological reality”. President Donald Trump of the U.S. signed an executive order banning transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports – a hotly debated, divisive topic.\n\nThe ruling will have an impact on sport where athletics, cycling and aquatics have already banned transgender women from participating in women’s events. Reuters reported that the English Football Association has introduced stricter rules, but still allows transgender women in the women’s game as long as their testosterone was kept below a certain level. These norms are likely to change after the ruling.\n\nIn the U.S., Mr. Trump has also signed orders saying the government recognises only two sexes: male and female. Experts say “gender is a spectrum, not a binary structure”. India passed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act in 2019, which defines a transperson as someone whose gender does not match the one assigned at birth. It prohibits discrimination against them in employment, education, housing, healthcare and other services. But the community was aghast at some of the clauses, including a mandate that each person would have to be recognised as “transgender” on the basis of a certificate of identity issued by a district magistrate. This overlooked a recommendation by the 2016 Standing Committee to have a screening committee. If the district magistrate refused to hand out such a certificate, there was no scope for an appeal or redressal. The demand from trans people has always been that any legal framework should factor in suggestions from the community.",

Ramakrishna said that it was unfortunate that Mr. Dhankhar, who holds a constitutional post, made direct comments ‘attacking the judiciary’.\n\n“The Governors in many States are affiliated with the RSS.

The Supreme Court has recently ruled that Governors have no authority to stall such Bills. Yet, the Vice-President made unacceptable comments on the judiciary,” he said.\n\nMr. Ramakrishna said NDA allies such as Chief Ministers Chandrababu Naidu and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar— seen as secular leaders — supported the Waqf Amendment Bill, ‘helping spread unrest across the nation’.\n\n“Mr. Naidu should distance himself from this controversial legislation,” he said.\n\nResponding to a question about the new proposal to acquire over 43,000 acres of government land for capital project in Amaravati, Mr. Ramakrishna said that proposing to acquire another 43,000 acres of land shows that the government intends to focus development at only one place.\n\n“The people are questioning the government’s focus only on Amaravati, saying that ignoring the comprehensive development of the State is not appropriate. Does development of the State mean just Amaravati and Polavaram?” he asked, while referring to the people from the backwards regions of the State.",

    "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/west-bengal/in-murshidabad-scars-from-a-communal-fire/article69465495.ece",
    "content": "Three days have passed since a mob attacked dozens of shops and houses at Ghoshpara market in the Samsherganj area of Murshidabad district in West Bengal. The remnants of violence are everywhere. All that is left on the road leading to the Samsherganj police station are shards of broken glass, pieces of plastic and wooden debris, and shops with half-open shutters and damaged goods inside.\n\nOn the afternoon of April 11, protests broke out in the region over the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, which was passed in Parliament on April 3 and 4. The law gives the government a foot in the door in regulating Waqf properties and in settling disputes regarding such properties. The agitation turned violent when a mob went on a rampage at the market, located about 200 metres from the Samsherganj police station.\n\nBhakat Distributors, a lottery shop, is owned by Amar Bhakat and Bharati Medical, a pharmacy, by Anirban Hossain. Both shops were severely damaged by the mob. For years, Bhakat and Hossain did business side by side. But the violence has exposed the communal fault lines in the area.\n\n“My shop was targeted because it was owned by a Hindu,” says Bhakat, 54. “The mob smashed our computers, stole our furniture, and destroyed all the electrical appliances. They also looted the lakhs of rupees that I had stored for a payment that is due in a few days.”\n\nBhakat adds that the mob consisted of Muslims from the neighbourhood, who knew where people lived and who the shops belonged to. He and members of his extended family have fled the Dhulian municipality. Some of them have gone to Malda, about 30 kilometres away, while others have gone further, to Jharkhand.\n\nHossain, 42, says Muslims and Hindus have always lived in peace at Dhulian. “Even when the Babri Masjid was being demolished, there was no communal hatred or bitterness here. But that is history now,” he says.\n\nIn the violence that erupted on April 11 and 12 in Murshidabad, three people lost their lives — Hargobind Das (70) and his son Chandan Das (40), who were lynched on April 12 at Jafrabad village adjoining Dhulian municipality, and Ejaz Ahmed Sheikh (21), who died of injuries sustained in police firing, a few kilometres south of Dhulian, in Gazipur in Kashimnagar suburb.\n\nOne tragedy, different reactions\n\nJafrabad remains on the edge. Parul Das, who is in her 50s and has lost her husband Hargobind and son Chandan, recalls the attack again and again for journalists and politicians who visit her.\n\n“I was here when they broke into the house,” she says, sobbing. “They dragged both of them out and hacked them to death. My son was alive for a while. We kept calling the police, but no one came.” There are now five personnel of the Border Security Force (BSF) stationed a few hundred metres from her house.\n\nLeaders from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which is in the Opposition, and members of Hindutva groups have posted photographs of the two bodies on social media and described the violence as an “attack on Hindus”. They observed Hindu Martyrs Day in Kolkata on April 16. More than 40 MLAs of the BJP joined the Leader of the Opposition, Suvendu Adhikari, in demanding Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s resignation. Describing the murders as a “heinous crime”, the West Bengal Police have set up a special investigation team and made arrests from Murshidabad and adjoining districts.\n\nUnlike the Das family, Ejaz Ahmed Sheikh’s family has no security in front of their house. Sheikh’s one-storeyed house in Gazipur is located 4 km from Sajur More on National Highway 12, where he succumbed to bullet injuries.\n\nMiddle-aged female relatives and neighbours sit on the floor in the courtyard of the house. Sheikh’s wife, who refuses to give her name, says before slamming the door shut, “We are sick of recalling the events of that day. My mother-in-law is unwell. Please leave us alone.”\n\nSheikh’s cousin, Azhar, rushes into the house as it begins to rain. He says Sheikh is survived by his wife and two-year-old daughter.\n\nBanerjee has announced compensation of ₹10 lakh for the families of the deceased.\n\nThe smell of burnt wood\n\nIn the Betbona area of Dhulian municipality, scores of houses were set on fire. The smell of burnt wood and soot still lingers in the air. Betbona is primarily a Hindu neighbourhood.\n\nRita Ghosh, 32, hides the scars on her palms. She says she had to jump from the terrace of her house to escape the violence. “My elder son and husband hid inside our bedroom. I ran away with my younger son. When I came back, the whole village was up in flames, but thankfully, my husband and elder son survived,” she says.\n\nGhosh says the eight goats that the family had reared were charred to death. The family is left with nothing. “Before the violence, we were planning for my husband’s surgery. Now we don’t know how to survive,” she says.\n\nDebgon Mondal, 36, and his wife Deepa, 30, cannot forget how the mob, armed with batons and sticks, entered their neighbourhood.\n\n“We knew they would kill us if we didn’t run for our lives,” Mondol recalls. “We ran away as far as we could. When we returned, our house was up in flames. I helplessly watched it burn for three hours. We couldn’t put it out as our hand pumps and water taps were broken. We waited until the fire brigade arrived.” The house and the neighbourhood still bear visible signs of violence such as smashed electricity metres.\n\nDeepa is trying to wrap her head around what happened. She says, “If they wanted to loot us, which they did, why did they have to burn our house down?”\n\nJawans of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) march across the village. There is an uneasy calm in the neighbourhood, where lush mango trees face blackened houses.\n\nBacchu Mondal sits on a wooden bed, his head still throbbing with pain. A white bandage covers his forehead and the skin on his left cheek has peeled off. His five-year-old son picks up a two-foot-long wooden stick lying near a door. He says the mob used it to beat his father up.\n\nMondal recalls how the mob beat him up in front of a temple. “After a while, some of them started talking about whether they should keep beating me or let me go. I sensed an opportunity and ran,” he says. When Mondal talks of how the MLA of Sagardighi, Bayron Biswas, took him to a nursing home for treatment, a few villagers immediately rebuke him. “Don’t take his name,” they say. “He is Muslim.”\n\nA divided people\n\nReligious polarisation has become more pronounced in West Bengal over the last few years, says Subha Protim Roy Chowdhury, a political observer who has studied the violence that has broken out during Ram Navami celebrations.\n\nHe says, “The communal violence in Murshidabad has exposed the fault lines in the State’s politics and society. Over the last few decades, we have been observing regular communal flare-ups across the State, where people of both communities have been involved.”\n\nAlmost a week before the communal clashes at Murshidabad, hundreds of high-pitched Ram Navami processions were held across the State. These processions were attended not only by BJP leaders and Hindutva groups, but also by leaders of the Trinamool Congress.\n\nSenior police officials hint at the fact that these festivals pose a challenge. “There were many events planned (in the State) over the last 15 days and all of them were observed peacefully. The scale of mobilisation on Friday and Saturday (April 11 and 12) was high and a number of fronts were opened at the same time, so the police could not reach all the places with the same intensity,” says Jawed Shamim, Additional Director General (Law and Order), West Bengal Police.\n\nEven before the Ram Navami processions, people had gathered to protest against the Waqf (Amendment) Act in different parts of the State. While the Chief Minister had described the riots as a “pre-planned conspiracy” and had suggested that people from Bangladesh were involved, Murshidabad had been on the boil during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in 2019. Railway properties were attacked and railway lines were uprooted then. However, the two communities had not been pitted against one another during the CAA protests.\n\nRoy Chowdhury says Dhulian and Samsherganj are among the most impoverished regions of the State. “Men migrate from these regions for work and women roll beedis for a living. The beedi factories are controlled by local leaders, MLAs and MPs of the Trinamool Congress,” he says.\n\nHe says the Murshidabad riots stand apart because of the sheer number of people involved and affected. As of April 17, the West Bengal Police registered 60 First Information Reports and arrested 274 people for their involvement in the violence. “This is also the first time that such a large number of people from one community had to take shelter in another district to escape violence,” says Roy Chowdhury.\n\nNo place called home\n\nThe Ganga meanders across Dhulian and Samsherganj. Across the river is Malda district. This is where the river enters West Bengal. As violence erupted in the Dhulian municipality on April 11 and April 12, hundreds of families took small ferry boats from Kanchantala ghat and Sadar ghat to Malda’s Parlalpur ghat.\n\nAround 320 people from 58 families have taken shelter at the Parlalpur high school in Kaliachak III block, almost 1 kilometre from Parlalpur ghat. In the two-storey school, 3-4 families share a classroom. Those who have taken refuge are mostly women and children, as the men are away in other States working as migrant workers.\n\nThe Malda district administration has made arrangements for a community kitchen. The camp is frequented by local Hindu religious organisations, who distribute clothes, dry fruits, mosquito nets, and other essentials.\n\nKalpana Mondal, a resident of ward 7 of Dhulian, who has taken shelter in the camp, is upset that she has not received a mosquito net. “I don’t know why I am not getting any of these items. The other day, some people distributed sarees and dhotis. The day before that, they distributed gamchas (cloth covering); I didn’t get those either. If my sons were at home, I would not have left even after the violence,” she says.\n\nAs her three sons work as migrant workers, Kalpana fled from Dhulian with six goats to the camp on April 11. The middle-aged woman has left the animals at a relative’s place near the camp. Like many others, she refuses to go home until BSF personnel are stationed at the municipality permanently. On April 12, the Calcutta High Court directed the deployment of CAPF personnel in violence-affected areas.\n\nProtima Mondal is hoping to find some work in the school so that she does not have to return to Dhulian. “I have nothing left there. My house was set on fire,” she says.\n\nA woman from Dhulian has just received a mosquito net from a Hindu religious organisation. She regularly receives calls from her son, who works in another city, urging her to go back home. She whispers that her daughter-in-law, who is staying in the camp with her, is Muslim. She says if the people in the camp come to know about this, she might face issues. “Initially, we did not accept the marriage. But what could I do when they were in love? I am from a part of Dhulian where we are surrounded by more Muslim than Hindu families. She is one of us now. I have even given her a Hindu nickname,” she says.\n\nThe district administration has also set up a small medical desk to provide medical aid. However, for some elderly people who require specialised medicine and care, these are not enough.\n\nA number of leaders from political parties, including State BJP president Sukanta Majumdar, have visited the camp and offered to help those displaced by the violence. Majumdar also held protests with a number of displaced people outside the West Bengal Police headquarters in Kolkata on April 16. The next day, he met Governor C.V. Ananda Bose with a group of victims.\n\nWhile the State administration insists that the situation is slowly returning to normal and people who have taken shelter in the camps are going back home, on April 17, the Governor decided to meet the violence-affected people despite the Chief Minister urging him to postpone his visit.\n\nThe West Bengal Police claimed on April 17 that 85 people had returned to Dhulian and 70% of the shops had been re-opened.\n\nBut for some, there are still no signs of normalcy. Farida Bibi, 60, hovers anxiously in the Samsherganj police station. She says two of her sons, Kokhan Sheikh, 32, and Milan Sheikh, 28, were picked up by the police. “They were working on the construction of our house this morning when the police came and picked them up,” she adds.\n\nOn spotting a police van entering the police station carrying a dozen young men, Farida turns quiet. “They are not here,” she says and resumes her search.\n\nmoyurie.som@thehindu.co.in",

Putting pressure on me not to speak up, the ban also aims to weaken the centrality of Muslim institutions of the valley, Jama Masjid, office of the Mirwaiz, and cause collective grief to Muslims and all those who oppose this authoritarian and sectarian outlook,” the Mirwaiz said, in a post on X.\n\nHe said his house detention case was still pending in court. “I am seeking relief from the High Court. In such times, patience remains our only strength,” the Mirwaiz said.\n\nThe Mirwaiz’s political outfit, Awami Action Committee (AAC), was also banned by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). Of late, the Mirwaiz said he has repeatedly been denied permission to visit the Jama Masjid in Srinagar on Fridays, where he delivers sermons as a cleric. The Mirwaiz has also spearheaded the anti-Waqf (Amendments) Act agitation in J&K.\n\nThe J&K Police comes under J&K Lieutenant-Governor Manoj Sinha and has not issued any statement over the move to restrict the movement of the Mirwaiz.\n\nThe ruling National Conference (NC) took exception to the move to bar the Mirwaiz from attending Friday prayers. “Preventing a religious leader from carrying out his religious obligations is deeply unjust. Genuine normalcy must extend to everyone without exception,” NC leader and legislator Tanvir Sadiq said.",

    "content": "If a decision is made on expanding the UN Security Council, \"then surely\" India will be a contender, Chair of Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN) on UNSC reforms on Thursday said.\n\n\"The goal of this reformed Council must be representative. Obviously, India is a main player on the world stage today. But it [UN] is a membership of 193 countries. The consideration is representative for everybody and the whole membership of the United Nations,\" Ambassador Tareq AlBanai said at a press briefing here.\n\n\"So surely, if the decision is made that expansion of the Council goes to from anywhere from 21 to 27 members, then surely India will be a contender in that and will be subject to the decision of the wider membership,\" Mr. AlBanai said in response to a question by PTI.\n\nMr. AlBanai, who is Kuwait's Permanent Representative to the UN, recalled that last year he and co-Chair Ambassador Alexander Marschik of Austria had visited India and had a conversation there \"at the highest level\" on the issue of UNSC reform.\n\nUpdating on the progress made in the IGN process during the current 79th UNGA session, the ambassador said while the road to reform is “undeniably complex, we are taking steady and meaningful steps toward the path forward”.\n\nHe noted that aside from an increase in the number of elected members in 1965, the first iteration of the Security Council has lasted over 80 years. \"Whatever formulation the reformed Council takes, it must be designed to endure for the next century, anchored in the principles of inclusivity, transparency, efficiency, effectiveness, democracy and accountability.\"\n\nResponding to a question on how many members an expanded UNSC must have, he said there is no decision yet but the numbers being floated range between 21 and 27 member states.\n\nTo a question on text-based negotiations, Mr. AlBanai noted that India's position has always been to move towards text-based negotiations as soon as possible. \"Obviously, this process will lead us to text-based negotiations\" as that is the \"least complicated\" part of this process.\n\n\"The most complicated part is to have consent on what that text contains, and then putting it on paper is not really going to be that difficult… Do we have consensus? Yes, we have consensus on many issues regarding the five clusters, many issues of convergence that we have been able to put together over all those many years. There are still some issues of contention, but we are working steadily and surely to make sure that we overcome those,\" Mr. AlBanai said.\n\nThe five issues are categories of membership, question of the veto, regional representation, size of an enlarged Security Council, and working methods of the Council, and relationship between the Council and the General Assembly.\n\nMr. AlBanai said he is \"encouraged\" by the momentum shown by the Member States in this session. \"The spirit of reform requires both courage and creativity, and the active engagement of all delegations remains essential as we work to find consensus on core elements of Security Council reform.\"\n\nEarlier this week, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador, P. Harish, in a statement on behalf of the G4 nations of Brazil, Germany, Japan, and India, told an IGN meeting that the existing UN architecture is from a different era, one that no longer exists and the current geopolitical realities warrant a review of this architecture.\n\nMr. Harish said Security Council membership needs to be increased from the current 15 to 25 or 26, with a reformed Council consisting of 11 permanent members and 14 or 15 non-permanent members.\n\nAt present, the powerful UN organ consists of five veto-wielding permanent members -- China, France, Russia, U.K., and the U.S. The remaining 10 members are elected to sit at the horse-shoe table for two-year terms as non-permanent members. India last sat in the Council as a non-permanent member in 2021-22.\n\nThe G4 nations have also encouraged Member States to submit further model of reforms in order to facilitate text-based negotiations. \"We invite the Chair to start text-based negotiations now, ideally by the end of the current IGN,\" the group has said.\n\nMr. AlBanai and Mr. Marschik last February met External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, who in a post on X said he “appreciated their assessment of the ongoing discussions on UNSC reform”. “The international community hopes that under their stewardship the IGN process moves forward this year,” he posted online.\n\nAfter the meeting, Kuwait's Permanent Mission had on X said that both sides discussed ongoing developments with regards to the reform process, and ways in which it could be further developed.\n\n\"The co-chairs thanked India's Minister of External Affairs for the generous invitation, and commended India's commitment to this vital process,\" the Mission said.\n\nMr. AlBanai, however, said he could not tell whether the reform would take place by 2030 or any other year.\n\n“I’m very positive about breaking down whatever barriers there are because people are understanding that we need something different and Member States are understanding that this is the recourse of the world community to tackle all issues, including peace and security, development and human rights,” he said.\n\n\"We are all working together to make this a better United Nations … Security Council reform process is a part and parcel of that,\" he said.",

    "content": "Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Friday (April 18, 2025) said the police “will have to adapt to emerging technologies and deploy them to enhance their operational effectiveness”, as he pledged to end terrorism in both the regions of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\n“We need a future-ready police force to effectively combat evolving terror and organised crime threats. In view of the rapid changes taking place due to technology, our approach should be on data-centric policing to effectively tackle challenges, analyse crime trends and predict the pattern and make necessary changes in the investigation,” Mr. Sinha said.\n\nHe was speaking at the passing out parade function of the 16th Batch of Basic Recruit Training Course (BRTC) of the J&K Police Constables at Manigam Police Training School, Ganderbal. A total of 438 recruits, including 86 women, completed their training.\n\nUnderlining that the nation was grateful to the J&K Police for the invaluable sacrifices they have made, Mr. Sinha said: “Today the J&K Police force is admired across the country for its professionalism, sustained grit and determination. In the last few years, the J&K Police force, Army and CAPFs have succeeded in crushing terrorism in the Kashmir Valley.”\n\nHowever, the LG, who commands the J&K Police of the Union Territory, expressed concern over the increase in terrorist attacks in the Jammu division. “It is a matter of concern. Our resolve is to make both Jammu and Kashmir divisions terrorism-free,” Mr. Sinha said.\n\nStressing the need to introduce the emerging technologies and deploy them to enhance the operational effectiveness of the J&K Police, Mr. Sinha said: “Citizens can live peacefully and work freely because they know that our police force is standing firm in protecting their lives and combating terrorism and crime.”\n\nHe said the exemplary courage of the J&K Police and their supreme heroism reassures the people that UT is in safe hands.",

    "content": "K. Jayaprakash Hegde, former chairman of the Karnataka State Commission for Backward Classes, submitted the Socio-Economic and Educational Survey (caste census) report to the State government in 2024. The report, now being debated in the Cabinet, has created a storm in Karnataka politics over the last week. The Hindu spoke to him about the issues being debated around the contentious report.\n\nEdited excerpts:\n\nThe leaders of some communities have said that the survey is unscientific and not all houses were visited. How do you defend the survey?\n\nThe survey was conducted by over 1.3 lakh teachers of the State, overseen by the government machinery. There was a pro forma with 56 questions to collect socio, economic and educational details of each family, including their caste. These pro formas are still with the district administrations, including the signatures of the persons interviewed. Answers to 56 questions, with the signatures cannot be manufactured by teachers. This voluminous data was digitised by Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) and ratified by Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore. I don’t understand how it can be called unscientific.\n\nNot just Veerashaiva-Lingayats and Vokkaligas, several other communities have also disputed their population count. Many say surveyors had not visited every household.\n\nIt is true that we have not been able to cover every household. The projected population of the State in 2015 was 6.35 crore and we have covered over 6 crore, which is around 95% of the State’s population. It is a very good survey by any objective yardstick. Moreover, even among those 30 lakh-plus population not included in the survey, there is no way only some community households can be left out, when the survey itself is a decentralised activity by 1.3 lakh government teachers from all communities and regions.\n\nEvery community seems to be inflating their numbers. If the claims of all the communities are considered, I wonder what the State’s population would be. Meanwhile, the government still has the option to get the survey updated, if it feels it needs to.\n\nBut in the case of Veerashaiva-Lingayats, some members of their sub castes like Ganiga Lingayats, Banajiga Lingayats and Sadara Lingayats may have identified as belonging to their equivalent communities in the larger Hindus society to claim reservation under Category 2A. I don’t deny this. But the survey cannot be faulted for this.\n\nComing to the recommendations by the commission you headed, one of the recommendations being opposed is applying creamy layer for even Category 1, which has most backward communities. Why was it introduced?\n\nRecently, even the Supreme Court has said creamy layer should be applied to all categories of reservation. This will prevent the same sections within a community from getting benefits of reservation over generations. It is a progressive step to ensure better distribution of reservation benefits.\n\nMany communities including the Kurubas, generally considered to be well off, have moved from more backward category to most backward category. What does this tell us of reservation as a tool of social upliftment over the past four decades?\n\nAn expert committee was constituted for evaluating each community based on their socio-economic and educational indicators, found out from the survey. Each community was marked for 200 marks and depending on the marks awarded to each community and slabs chosen, communities have been categorised as most backward, more backward, and backward. This is not an ad hoc classification. It is based on data collected and the decision of the expert committee.\n\nCommunities moving from earlier classification of more backward to most backward in our recommendation, doesn’t mean they have regressed. This is the first time this quality of socio-economic and educational data is available for each community. This reflects the reality as against earlier classifications, based on dipstick surveys and sometimes ad hoc decisions. For instance, the Kurubas are revealed to be more backward than what they are perceived to be.\n\nThere are concerns that some communities like the Kurubas, who are considered to be relatively dominant and are in large numbers, will dominate a category, depriving other smaller communities in the same category of reservation benefits. Kurubas are now in Category 1B with 12% reservation, as per your recommendation, along with several other smaller communities. How to avoid such a scenario?\n\nApplication of creamy layer should ideally prevent such misuse and protect smaller communities.\n\nThe Panchamasalis have been demanding that they should be given reservation under a separate category and not along with Veerashaiva-Lingayats. Their demand has not been met as per your recommendations. What is the rationale behind this?\n\nPanchamasalis are a sub caste group of Veerashaiva-Lingayats and share the same characteristics. All sub castes of a community are kept under the same reservation category and hence Panchamasalis cannot be moved to another category.",

    "content": "Belagavi city corporation has passed a resolution to facilitate transfer of civilian areas from Military cantonment in the old city areas. This follows an instruction from the state government to all the cantonment cities in the State.\n\nThe issue was discussed at a recent meeting of the Finance Standing Committee. Members adopted a resolution to facilitate the transfer of residential colonies, markets, bungalows, grounds, and open spaces within the Cantonment area to the Corporation. This is different from an earlier BCC decision to take over only residential areas in the cantonment.\n\nCommittee chairperson Netravati Bhagwat, Mayor Mangesh Pawar, Deputy Mayor Vani Joshi, and others were present in the meeting.\n\nThis follows a meeting with Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Roshan, who communicated to the officers a decision of the State government. The State government has asked all urban local bodies to seek the decision to transfer all components of the civilian-use areas in military cantonment areas. Around 1763 acres of land in Belagavi city are managed by the cantonment board, which is distinct from the BCC. However, with the BCC seeking transfer of all civil areas, a significant portion of the city will be administered by the BCC in the future, after the transfer is affected.\n\nMeanwhile, the members of the Belgaum Cantonment Residents’ Welfare Association (BCRWA) have urged the state government to build the new Deputy Commissioner’s office on the 102 acres of the abandoned military farm in the cantonment, rather than far off places like Suvarna Soudha, Kanabargi or Hindalga as is being considered now.\n\nMinisters Satish Jarkiholi and Laxmi Hebbalkar have recently inspected these sites, along with the present DC office premises. The abandoned military farm lies in the heart of the city, near Bogarves circle. It would be well suited for the purpose of the DC office. The BCRWA had earlier suggested the abandoned Military Dairy Farm as a suitable site, an idea appreciated by the Defence Secretary, it mentioned.\n\nThe present DC office area is overcrowded and inaccessible during public protests. The other shortlisted locations are remote and far from the city. Relocating the DC office to far-flung areas is impractical. It is better to utilize the 102 acres of centrally located, vacant land of the former Military Dairy Farm. The defence ministry is willing to transfer the land to the State government under the “Equal Value Exchange Scheme. It can have full full-fledged government office complex with tree-lined roads, ample parking, and a maidan for public gatherings. If the government delays, private buyers might develop the land into hotels and malls. The State government should negotiate with the Union Government for approval for the transfer, the letter further stated.\n\nThe association office bearers Omarfarooq Nawab, Ranjan Shetti, Nitin Khot and others have signed the letter.",

    "content": "The Belagavi district central cooperative bank has achieved significant success in the last year, its office bearers said in Belagavi on Thursday.\n\nBank president Appasaheb Kulgude said it achieved a net profit of ₹33.11 crore and gained a share capital of ₹303 crore in the past year. Last year’s profit was ₹30.57 crore.\n\n“It has collected deposits of ₹6,087 crore and investments of up to ₹2,276 crore. It has given external loans of ₹1,664 crore and member loans of ₹5,893 crore. It has achieved a net profit of ₹33.11 crore and has a working capital of ₹8,593 crore. Gross NPA is 2.07%,” he said.\n\nAccording to him, the bank was making steady progress year after year. It earned the trust of farmers and customers by earning high profits.\n\nMLA and director Balachandra Jarkiholi said that new schemes would be implemented to benefit farmers and new technological tools would be utilised to facilitate. “We have given a large number of loans and recovered them in time. There are no dues from any factory or institution. Individual loans are being followed up,” he said.\n\nThe bank completed its centenary a few years ago. But it was not celebrated due to the COVID lockdown. We have decided to hold a ceremony in the presence of central and state leaders in the coming May-end or the first week of June, the MLA said. “Efforts will be made to increase the bank’s profit by increasing the deposit. All the branches in the district will be provided with various facilities, including furniture, uniform lime, paint, and other materials,” he said.\n\nBank director and former MP Annasaheb Jolle said that BDCC Bank had the distinction of giving the highest loan to farmers in the state. Under the current scheme, a target of ₹3,175 crore was given to disburse short-term crop loans. But our bank has disbursed ₹3,475.66 crore to 4,88,379 farmer members of the district, achieving 109.47 percent, exceeding the target. Last year, ₹3,060.42 crore was distributed to 4,68,775 farmer members. This year, 19,604 new members have been given loans. ₹415.24 crore has been given more crop loans, he said.\n\nMr. Jolle said the refinance funds from NABARD were steadily falling. Our bank was eligible for ₹1,270 crore refinance under the NABARD Punar Dhan Loan Scheme, but last year it got only ₹774 crore. In the current financial year, we got ₹313 crore less than that, he said.\n\nHowever, despite this constraint, we have issued loans of ₹415.24 crore to farmers. The recovery rate of these loans is 99.22%. BDCC is the bank that has given the highest crop loans in the state, Mr. Jolle said.\n\n“In order to benefit the farmers of the district, loans of up to ₹15 lakh are being given at an interest rate of 3% for the purchase of tractors, trailers, agricultural equipment, irrigation pipelines and pump sets. Over ₹161.48 crore has been disbursed to 2014 farmer members for the purchase of tractors, ₹1,790 crore to 378 farmer members for pipelines, and ₹3.64 crore to 609 farmers for dairy farming. The loan recovery rate is 99.78%,” he said.\n\nDue to the trust placed by the farmers, cooperatives, and customers in the bank, this year the deposit of ₹6,087 crore has been collected, which has increased by ₹290 crore this year. Compared to last year, the working capital has increased by 8.84%.\n\nThe bank has disbursed a total of ₹1,486.96 crore to eight cooperative sugar factories and 15 private sugar factories, out of which the working capital loan is ₹877.15 crore, and the term loan is ₹608.91 crore. However, due to reduced sugarcane crushing, it was difficult to recover a total of around ₹360 crore in principal and interest payments that were due this year.\n\nMobile banking service has been started for the convenience of customers. He said that online banking services like IMPS, UPI, Google Pay, Phone Pay etc. will be started soon.\n\nPermission has been obtained to start nine new branches in the district. They will come up in Badal Ankalagi, Hudali, Belagundi , Naganur of Bailahongal taluk, Ambadagatti Kalabambi of Kittur taluk, Nasalapur, Nipanal of Raybag taluk, Kakkeri of Khanapur taluk.\n\nDirector and former MLA Mahantesh Dodagoudra said a total loan of ₹35 crore has been given to 1850 women’s SHG groups this year. They get zero-interest loans up to ₹5 five lakh per group.",

    "content": "Aiming to boost Jharkhand’s industry and energy sectors, Chief Minister Hemant Soren and his wife Kalpana Soren, an MLA in the State Assembly, embarked on a nine-day trip to Sweden and Spain on Friday (April 18, 2025).\n\nBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State president and Leader of Opposition Babulal Marandi opposed the trip at a time of law-and-order problems in Jharkhand. He also objected to Mr. Soren taking his wife on the official tour, asking why the State’s Industries Minister had been left out of the delegation.\n\nThe Jharkhand delegation will visit Barcelona and Madrid in Spain, and Gothenburg in Sweden between April 19 and 27. The delegation will meet foreign investors to tell them of the policies of the State government, and invite them to participate in mine auctions in Jharkhand.\n\nThe delegation includes Ms. Soren, who also chairs the Women and Child Welfare Committee in the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly, Chief Secretary Alka Tiwari, Additional Chief Secretary to the Chief Minister Avinash Kumar, State Industries Secretary Arwa Rajkamal, Industries Director Sushant Gaurav, Personal Advisor to the Chief Minister Ajay Kumar Singh, and others.\n\nIndustries Minister not included\n\nMr. Marandi posted on X, criticising Mr. Soren’s trip. “The law and order in the State has collapsed, murders are happening in broad daylight, power crisis has deepened. Amidst all this, the Chief Minister is leaving for Sweden and Spain with a large government delegation along with his MLA wife.”\n\nHe added: “If the purpose of this trip is to bring foreign investment, then the biggest question is why the Industry Minister is not being taken along? The Secretary and Director of the Industry Department are included in this delegation, but the name of the Industry Minister is missing from the list. Does the Minister have no role in the investment talks?”\n\nMr. Marandi alleged that it was not the first time that Industry Minister Sanjay Prasad Yadav, an RJD leader, was being humiliated. Earlier, at an important investment meeting in Kolkata, the Industry Minister was stopped from attending the meeting, and Mr. Soren took his wife along in his place at the last minute, Mr. Marandi said.\n\n“Hemant ji, if this trip is official, then in what capacity is Kalpana Soren attending in place of the Industry Minister? If this is a personal trip, then why is an army of officers being sent at the expense of the government treasury?” Mr. Marandi asked. He expressed his surprise that a retired Indian Foreign Service officer has also been included in the delegation.\n\nInvestment strategy\n\nA senior official of the Industries Department said that the CM’s visit is part of the State’s comprehensive strategy to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in dynamic sectors such as steel and metals, energy (conventional and renewable), advanced manufacturing, and infrastructure development.\n\nJharkhand is one of India’s most resource-rich States, and contributes significantly to the country’s industrial output, with some big names like Tata Steel, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) active in the State.\n\nThe scheduled business forums and B2B meetings will inform Spanish companies about Jharkhand’s ambitious industrial roadmap, investor facilitation policies, and opportunities for public-private cooperation. The delegation will also hold meetings in Sweden.",

Israel has designated it as a humanitarian zone.\n\nFour other people were killed in separate strikes in Rafah city, including a mother and her daughter, according to the European Hospital, where the bodies were brought.\n\nIsrael has vowed to intensify attacks across Gaza and occupy large “security zones” inside the strip. For six weeks Israel also has blockaded Gaza, barring the entry of food and other goods.\n\nThis week, aid groups raised alarm saying that thousands of children have become malnourished, and most people are barely eating one meal a day as stocks dwindle, according to the United Nations.\n\nOn Friday, Dr. Hanan Balkhy, the head of the World Health Organization’s eastern Mediterranean office, urged the new U.S. ambassador in Israel, Mike Huckabee, to push the country to lift Gaza's blockade so medicines and other aid can enter the strip. “I would wish for him to go in and see the situation firsthand,” she said.\n\nIn his first appearance as ambassador on Friday, Huckabee visited the Western Wall, the holiest Jewish prayer site in Jerusalem’s Old City. He inserted a prayer into the wall, which he said was handwritten by U.S. President Donald Trump. Huckabee said every effort was being made to bring home the remaining hostages held by Hamas.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Most of the hostages have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.\n\nIsrael’s offensive has since killed over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants. The war has destroyed vast parts of Gaza and most of its food production capabilities. The war has displaced around 90% of the population, with hundreds of thousands of people living in tent camps and bombed-out buildings.",

    "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/news-analysis-why-ukraine-ceasefire-remains-elusive/article69467736.ece",
    "content": "During his campaign, Donald Trump famously claimed that, if elected, he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours. To his credit, Mr. Trump, after returning to the White House in January, launched a peace initiative. He spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone at least twice, and his envoy, Steve Witkoff, made several trips to Russia to explore the possibility of a ceasefire with Mr. Putin and other senior Russian officials. As part of this effort, Mr. Trump temporarily suspended weapons deliveries to Ukraine and halted intelligence sharing. Under pressure, Kyiv proposed an interim truce, which Mr. Putin rejected. In turn, Russia offered a 30-day mutual suspension of attacks on energy infrastructure. Yet, there was no significant progress toward a ceasefire.\n\nThe Trump administration’s growing frustration over its inability to achieve a breakthrough was evident in the remarks of Marco Rubio, the U.S. Secretary of State, on Friday (April 18). “If it’s not possible to end the war in Ukraine we need to move on,” Mr. Rubio stated after talks with European diplomats in Paris. “It’s not our war. We have other priorities to focus on,” he said. Later that day, at the White House, Mr. Trump appeared to endorse Mr. Rubio’s comments. “If for some reason one of the two parties (Russia or Ukraine) makes it very difficult, we’re just going to say, ‘You’re foolish, you’re fools, you’re horrible people,’” Mr. Trump said. “And we’re just going to take a pass. But hopefully we won’t have to do that.” Meanwhile, in Moscow, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, announced that the 30-day pause on attacks on energy facilities had expired.\n\nU.S. views\n\nWhy does the diplomatic path to ending the war remain so difficult? The answer lies in the fundamentally divergent positions of the parties involved. Mr. Trump and his top officials have argued that the Ukraine war holds limited relevance to America’s security. Mr. Trump, who doesn’t subscribe to the trans-Atlantic worldview of America’s liberal internationalists, is also seeking a reset in America’s ties with Russia. But such a reset remains impossible without first bringing the Ukraine war to an end.\n\nThe U.S. has already made some major concessions to Russia. Prior to U.S.-Russia negotiations, Pete Hegseth, Mr. Trump’s Defence Secretary, stated that Ukraine would not be offered NATO membership. He also made clear that the U.S. would not be part of any postwar security guarantee arrangement for Ukraine, while officials of Mr. Trump signalled that Russia could keep the territories it has captured from Ukraine — which is more than 20% of the pre-2014 Ukraine. According to a recent Bloomberg report, the Trump administration was open to recognising Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula Russia annexed in 2014 following a referendum, as Russian territory as part of a broader ceasefire agreement.\n\nA brief history of the Russia-Ukraine war | Explained\n\nRussian position\n\nOn the other side, the Russians appear to recognise this is a rare opportunity to shut down the war, and are eager to engage the Trump administration. But if Mr. Trump’s focus is on achieving a ceasefire, what Russia seeks is a comprehensive” peace agreement. This means, Russia wants to address what Mr. Putin called the “root causes” of the war, not just to freeze the war along the frontline. Russia has put forward three core demands. First, Ukraine must remain a neutral country (meaning, no NATO membership and no NATO troops stationed on its territory); second, the five oblasts that Russia has annexed (Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson) must be formally recognised as part of the Russian Federation, and Western sanctions be lifted; third, Ukraine must be demilitarised. The Russians believe that they currently hold strategic momentum on the battlefield and are unwilling to surrender that advantage for a temporary ceasefire. A frozen conflict, akin to the Korean armistice of 1953, would merely perpetuate the conflict rather than resolve it.\n\nUkraine’s worries\n\nThen there are Ukraine and its European allies. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian President, finds the Russian demands difficult to swallow. Having already lost significant portions of Ukraine’s territories, he is understandably unwilling to go down in history as the leader who legitimised those losses. It could also mean an end to his political career. Mr. Zelenskyy has repeatedly stated that Ukraine will never concede its territories, and he continues to seek credible security guarantees from the West— something Russia categorically rejects. So far, the farthest Mr. Zelenskyy has been willing to is to freeze the conflict, without surrendering the right to rearm and remobilise Ukraine’s forces. Several European countries, including France and the U.K., share this position. They believe that if Ukraine and Europe swallow Russian demands, that would effectively rewrite the security architecture of Europe, bolstering Russia’s status as a great power. Europe today sees Ukraine as a critical buffer between Russia and its mainland. A full Ukrainian capitulation, in Europe’s views, would weaken its strategic position. As a result, the continent’s major powers prefer Ukraine to continue to fight or retain the right to continue to arm itself in the event of a ceasefire rather than settle for a peace agreement with Russia.\n\nSo America wants a ceasefire. Ukraine could accept a ceasefire but it wants security guarantees besides retaining its right to rearm itself. Europe wants to keep Ukraine’s armed forces strong. But Russia, which believes it is winning the war, wants a comprehensive peace deal that addresses its core security concerns, not just a truce deal. As there is little common ground among the main players, Mr. Trump’s overtures for peace seems to have hit a stonewall.",

    "content": "The Supreme Court on Saturday (April 19, 2025) blocked, for now, the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th century wartime law.\n\nIn a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center “until further order of this court.”\n\nJustices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.\n\nSupreme court on deportation\n\nThe high court acted in an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given “a reasonable time” to contest their pending removals.\n\n“We are deeply relieved that the Court has temporarily blocked the removals. These individuals were in imminent danger of spending the rest of their lives in a brutal Salvadoran prison without ever having had any due process,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said in an email.\n\nOn Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation, even as one judge said the case raised legitimate concerns. Early Saturday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also refused to issue an order protecting the detainees from being deported.\n\nThe administration is expected to return to the Supreme Court quickly in an effort to persuade the justices to lift their temporary order.\n\nThe ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nIn an emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU warned that immigration authorities were accusing other Venezuelan men held there of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang, which would make them subject to President Donald Trump's use of the act.\n\nAlien Enemies Act\n\nThe act has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended it gave them power to swiftly remove immigrants they identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.\n\nFollowing the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges in Colorado, New York and southern Texas promptly issued orders barring removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court.\n\nBut there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Wesley Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn't started yet.\n\nBut the ACLU's Friday filing included sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday. In one case, immigration lawyer Karene Brown said her client, identified by initials, was told to sign papers in English even though the client only spoke Spanish.\n\n“ICE informed F.G.M. that these papers were coming from the President, and that he will be deported even if he did not sign it,” Brown wrote.\n\nGelernt said in a Friday evening hearing before District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C., that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funneled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport.\n\nWith Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU's request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless Friday.\n\n“I’m sympathetic to everything you’re saying,” Boasberg told Gelernt. “I just don’t think I have the power to do anything about it.”\n\nBoasberg this week found there's probable cause that the Trump administration committed criminal contempt by disobeying his initial deportation ban. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated.\n\nDrew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a “minimum” of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court. He said no flights were scheduled for Friday night and he was unaware of any Saturday, but the Department of Homeland Security said it reserved the right to remove people then.\n\nICE said it would not comment on the litigation.\n\nAlso Friday, a Massachusetts judge made permanent his temporary ban on the administration deporting immigrants who have exhausted their appeals to countries other than their home countries unless they are informed of their destination and given a chance to object if they'd face torture or death there.\n\nSome Venezuelans subject to Trump's Alien Enemies Act have been sent to El Salvador and housed in its notorious main prison.",

    "content": "The U.S. government on Saturday (April 19, 2025) denied targeting Indians specifically amongst thousands of student visa revocations after a survey found 50% of those reporting the revocations were Indian. While the Ministry of External Affairs hasn’t confirmed whether growing concerns over the future for Indian students affected by the revocations will be raised with U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance and senior U.S. State Department officials arriving in Delhi on Monday (April 21, 2025), the issue could cause some awkward moments during the visit.\n\nThe survey, conducted by the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) studied 327 responses to a research call, out of an estimated more than 4,000 revocation notices sent out in the last two months, and found half had gone to Indians. The study was described in a policy brief that found “50% of these students were from India, followed by 14% from China,” adding that other significant countries in the data included South Korea, Nepal, and Bangladesh.\n\nWhen asked about the report, and the indication that Indians were particularly targeted for the revocation of the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme (SEVIS) status, an American official, who asked not to be named, denied the process was discriminatory against Indians.\n\n“Continuous vetting and visa revocation actions are not limited to visa holders from any specific country or area in the world. All visa applicants and visa holders, no matter the visa type and where they are located, are continuously vetted,” the official told The Hindu in a written response.\n\nThe rapid increase in SEVIS terminations came after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio launched a new AI-assisted “Catch and Revoke” program that would identify students believed to have political views inimical to U.S. Foreign policy interests based on their social media posts. In addition, the Department of Homeland Security is carrying out a nationwide crackdown on students whose names allegedly feature in police databases, and terminating their student status due to visa violations according to US immigration laws.\n\nTwo Indian researchers, Ranjani Srinivasan and Badar Khan Suri were among the first batch of students detained or told to “self-deport” in the first round of such notices, where the MEA had cautioned Indian students to “follow the law” . Subsequently, a number of Indian students have approached courts to have their SEVIS status restored, and in an indication of a shift in the MEA’s stance, Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal disclosed this week that the Indian embassy and missions are “in touch” with affected students and were offering support.\n\nThe AILA study found many of those whose visa has been revoked had been in police reports for minor traffic violations or campus infractions, while in an extreme case, a student who was a victim of domestic abuse had their visa cancelled because their name appeared in the police complaint. Only 2 of the 327 responses received pertained to allegations that the students were involved in any political activity, and lawyers have pointed out that protesting is not illegal per se, and that the students risked losing their futures due to the government’s action.\n\n“International students contribute billions of dollars to [the U.S.] economy. Scholars and researchers are making this country stronger by doing incredibly valuable work in cancer research, space travel, computer technology and almost every area of science and research. Driving them elsewhere not only weakens our economy but threatens our national security,” AILA Executive Director Ben Johnson said.\n\nThe MEA declined to comment on whether the issue would be raised directly with Mr. Vance, or other officials like US Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Ricky Gill who will be in Delhi on April 21 for official meetings. Mr. Vance, who is accompanied by his family is expected to be hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n“The discussions held during that meeting (between Mr. Modi and Mr. Vance) will cover all bilateral issues between India and the United States,” Mr. Jaiswal said on Friday, without elaborating on whether U.S. tariffs or other specific problems would be on the agenda. Mr. Vance will travel next to Jaipur and Agra while State Department officials will attend an India-U.S. forum hosted by the MEA and organised by the Ananta Centre.",

    "content": "Donald Trump’s simmering discontent with the U.S. Federal Reserve boiled over this week, with the president threatening to take the unprecedented step of ousting the head of the fiercely independent central bank.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly said he wants rate cuts now to help stimulate economic growth as he rolls out his tariff plans, and has threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell if he does not comply, putting the bank and the White House on a collision course that analysts warn could destabilise U.S. financial markets.\n\n“If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” Mr. Trump said Thursday, referring to Mr. Powell, whose second four-year stint as Fed chair ends in May 2026.\n\nMr. Powell has said he has no plans to step down early, adding this week that he considers the bank’s independence over monetary policy to be a “matter of law.”\n\nWhy rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve matter to world markets\n\n“Clearly, the fact that the Fed chairman feels that he has to address it means that they are serious,” KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk told AFP, referring to the White House.\n\nStephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said she thinks “they will come into conflict,” but does not think “that the Fed is going to succumb to the political pressure.”\n\nMost economists agree that the administration’s tariff plans — which include a 10% “baseline” rate on imports from most countries — will put upward pressure on prices and cool economic growth, at least in the short term.\n\nThat would keep inflation well away from the Fed’s long-term target of 2%, and likely prevent policymakers from cutting rates in the next few months.\n\n“They’re not going to react because Trump posted that they should be cutting,” Ms. Roth said in an interview, adding that doing so would be “a recipe for a disaster” for the U.S. economy.\n\nFed independence ‘absolutely critical’\n\nMany legal scholars say the U.S. president does not have the power to fire the Fed chair or any of his colleagues on the bank’s 19-person rate-setting committee for any reason but cause.\n\nThe Fed system, created more than a century ago, is also designed to insulate the U.S. central bank from political interference.\n\n“Independence is absolutely critical for the Fed,” said Ms. Roth. “Countries that do not have independent central banks have currencies that are notably weaker and interest rates that are notably higher.”\n\nMoody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told AFP that “we’ve had strong evidence that impairing central bank independence is a really bad idea.”\n\n‘Can’t control the bond market’\n\nOne serious threat to the Fed’s independence comes from an ongoing case in which the Trump administration has indicated it will seek to challenge a 1935 Supreme Court decision denying the U.S. president the right to fire the heads of independent government agencies.\n\nThe case could have serious ramifications for the Fed, given its status as an independent agency whose leadership believes they cannot currently be fired by the president for any reason but cause.\n\nCracks emerge in GOP unity amid Trump trade war\n\nBut even if the Trump administration succeeds in court, it may soon run into the ultimate guardrail of Fed independence: The bond markets.\n\nDuring the recent market turbulence unleashed by Mr. Trump’s tariff plans, U.S. government bond yields surged and the dollar fell, signaling that investors may not see the United States as the safe haven investment it once was.\n\nFaced with the sharp rise in U.S. Treasury yields, the Trump administration paused its plans for higher tariffs against dozens of countries, a move that helped calm the financial markets.\n\nIf investors believed the Fed’s independence to tackle inflation was compromised, that would likely push up the yields on long-dated government bonds on the assumption that long-term inflation would be higher, and put pressure on the administration.\n\n“You can’t control the bond market. And that’s the moral of the story,” said Ms. Swonk. “And that’s why you want an independent Fed.”",

    "content": "Dozens of people including journalists appeared before a court in Istanbul on Friday (April 18, 2025), accused of attending banned demonstrations and disobeying police orders to disperse during anti-government protests that were triggered by the jailing of the city’s opposition mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu.\n\nMr. Imamoglu, seen as the main challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s 22-year rule, was arrested on March 19 and jailed days later on corruption charges.\n\n‘Politically motivated’\n\nHis imprisonment has been widely viewed as politically motivated and sparked nationwide protests. The government insists Turkiye’s judiciary is independent and that the courts operate independently.\n\nA total of 189 defendants, most of them university students, began defending themselves over charges of participating in banned protests and non-compliance with orders to disperse. Some have also been charged with carrying arms. Four photojournalists and three reporters who were covering the demonstrations were also on trial. The court, however, on Friday decided to separate their case from the main trial.\n\nThe defendants are among more than 2,000 people were detained for taking party in the country’s largest mass demonstrations in more than a decade. During the opening hearing, lawyers demanded acquittal for all 189 defendants.\n\nAmong them was Derin Doga Kus, a 23-year-old Istanbul University student, who was detained from her home on March 24 and released from jail last week along with dozens of other students. Their release followed concerted efforts by parents to have their children set free, with many holding daily vigils outside Silivri prison, west of Istanbul.\n\n“I spent 18 days in the Silivri prison,” Ms. Doga Kus said. “This is not a legal process. It is a process where the law is trampled on,” she said.",

    "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/museums-rethink-how-the-holocaust-should-be-shown/article69464971.ece",
    "content": "Historians are rethinking the way the Holocaust is being presented in museums as the world marks the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the last Nazi concentration camps this month.\n\nShocking images of the mass killings of Jews were \"used massively at the end of World War II to show the violence of the Nazis,\" historian Tal Bruttmann, a specialist on the Holocaust, told AFP.\n\nBut in doing so \"we kind of lost sight of the fact that is not normal to show\" such graphic scenes of mass murder, of people being humiliated and dehumanised, he said.\n\nUp to this year, visitors to the Memorial de Caen war museum in northern France were plunged into darkened rooms with life-sized photographs showing the horror of what happened in the camps and the mass executions earlier in the war.\n\n\"The previous generation of Holocaust museums used these images because it reinforces the horror,\" said James Bulgin, who is in charge of the Holocaust galleries at London's Imperial War Museum.\n\nThe difficulty with that is that it \"denies the people within the images any capacity for agency or respect or identity,\" he added.\n\n\"The other problem with Holocaust narratives is that they tend to relate the history of what the Nazis and their collaborators did, not what Jewish people experienced,\" argued the British historian.\n\nSome six million were murdered in the Nazi's attempt to wipe out European Jews.\n\n'No photos of killings'\n\nWhich is why \"there are no photographs of killings\" in the new, \"almost clinically white\" galleries dedicated to the Shoah at the Memorial de Caen, said Bruttmann, the scientific adviser on the project which opened this month.\n\n\"To show this absolute negation of human beings, there is no obligation to show images of such unprecedented violence,\" said the memorial's director Kleber Arhoul.\n\nHistorians at the Imperial War Museum had the same debate, but drew different conclusions.\n\nThey decided to still use graphic imagery. \"The images exist as part of the historical record, we can't suppress their existence,\" said Bulgin. \"But what we can do is meaningfully integrate them into the historical narrative.\"\n\nHe said they did consider not using them but felt it could lead to misinformation. \"All of that stuff exists on YouTube and Vimeo... but without us mediating it, shaping it, informing it, giving it context,\" he added.\n\nThe curator said they \"spoke to an enormous range\" of Jewish groups and the \"almost overwhelming consensus was that we should use the footage\".\n\nHowever, graphic images of the genocide are shown in smaller formats, often on panels that carry a warning and that you have to turn over to see. Distinctions are also made between photos taken by Jews themselves and those taken by the Nazis in the Warsaw ghetto.\n\nIsraeli historian Robert Rozett argued that \"we need these memorials to be aware of what human beings are capable of, and where open hatred can lead.\"\n\nAt the Yad Vashem memorial in Jerusalem, \"there are pictures that show mass executions. They are not gigantic but they are there,\" he said.\n\n\"The hardest pictures are not highlighted in any way,\" he said. For example, those showing the massacre of Babi Yar, near Kyiv, in 1941 do not show the moment of the killings but the aftermath. And those of the mass graves do not show the bodies but the clothes of the victims strewn on the ground.\n\nNazi death machine\n\nMuseums have also tended to concentrate on representing the ruthless, systematic efficiency of the Nazi death machine, experts say.\n\nThe first Holocaust memorials were \"dark, oppressive spaces with a highly industrialised architecture that very much centres on Auschwitz,\" Bulgin said.\n\nThat was \"enormously problematic and potentially slightly dangerous, because it has none of the human character that actually allowed it to happen.\"\n\nWhich is why the London museum has tried to concentrate on this being a genocide \"done by people, to people\", he said.\n\nThe new galleries in the Memorial de Caen have two distinct rooms. One on death camps like Auschwitz, the mass executions of the \"Holocaust by bullets\" and the mobile gas vans. The other deals with the concentration and work camps where prisoners were enslaved, brutalised and worked to death or died from hunger or disease.\n\nBut museums also have a duty to evoke the Jewish communities that were wiped out, Rozett insisted. \"If you're teaching the Holocaust, you have to talk about what happened before, about what was destroyed,\" he said.\n\nThe first Holocaust room at the Imperial War Museum addresses this by showing a film called \"The Presence of Absence\". At Yad Vashem, the visit begins with a sound and light show to draw people deep into those lost worlds.\n\n\"When you're teaching, you want somebody's mind and their heart,\" it says. \"You want them to identify. It's not enough just intellectual engagement. There has to be something emotional, but not overriding emotional.\"",

    "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/how-ai-is-aiding-trumps-immigration-crackdown/article69467207.ece",
    "content": "The United States under President Donald Trump is ramping up use of surveillance systems and artificial intelligence (AI) to track and arrest immigrants, raising fears that risks to accuracy and privacy could put almost anyone in danger of getting caught up in the crackdown.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other immigration control agencies are using a suite of AI tools — such as facial recognition scanners in public areas and robotic dogs patrolling the southern border for human movement — as part of the crackdown on alleged illegal immigration.\n\nMany of the AI tools that immigration agents are using have been in place for years and are a legacy of previous administrations, according to Saira Hussain, an attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights advocacy group.\n\nBut now these tools have \"a ramped-up scope in terms of who [they are] targeting,\" and a wider range of people will have access to the data these tools collect, Hussain said.\n\nThe pumped-up surveillance dragnet also includes services run by private contractors like Babel Street, which trawl immigrants' social media accounts to collect personal information.\n\nOnce that information is collected, agencies like DHS and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) use it to track locations of immigrants, map out their family trees and justify arrest warrants and deportation decisions.\n\nAn example of the widening scope is the government’s new “Catch and Revoke” program, launched under Secretary of State Marco Rubio in March.\n\nIt uses AI to monitor the public speech of foreign nationals, particularly student visa holders, to locate those “who appear to support Hamas or other designated terror groups,” the Axios news website reported.\n\nAnyone caught by the program is at immediate risk of losing their visa, and more than 300 foreign nationals, including those with student and visitor visas, have had their visas revoked under the initiative, according to Rubio.\n\n\"If they're taking activities that are counter to our ... national interest, to our foreign policy, we'll revoke the visa,\" Rubio told a news conference on March 28.\n\nDigital rights advocates point to the tendency of AI tools to spout false \"hallucinations\" - answers or information that looks real but is fabricated – which make them dangerous to use in situations that require precision like immigration enforcement.\n\nParomita Shah, executive director at immigrant rights firm Just Futures Law, said the arrests of migrants using these tools \"raise a lot of concerns about civil rights violations and abuses.\"\n\nSince Trump took office in January, there have been numerous cases of immigration officials acting on inaccurate AI data, rights advocates say.\n\nThese include Jonathan Guerrero, a U.S. citizen arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Philadelphia, and Jensy Machado, a U.S. citizen held at gunpoint while driving to work in Virginia. Each was later released.\n\nAn executive order signed by Trump in January suggested the possible return of \"Rapid DNA testing,\" a process used to verify migrant family connections that was scrapped in 2023 due to privacy and accuracy concerns.\n\n\"Technologies start at the border and creep into the interior without being proven to be accurate,\" said Hussain.\n\n\"I think accuracy is not what this administration is going for. They're really going for the big splashy news of ‘We were able to take down X many people.'\"\n\nTekendra Parmar, an independent tech analyst, agreed, saying accuracy is not a priority for the Trump administration that is more concerned with meeting deportation targets.\n\n\"The fallibility of the technology ... allows the current administration to create a rubber stamp deportation policy under the guise of artificial intelligence,\" Parmar said.\n\nNeither DHS nor ICE responded to requests for comment.\n\nSurveillance systems do not just target immigrants but rather all U.S. residents, citizens or not, researchers say.\n\nIn 2021, Georgetown University Law Center researchers found ICE had access to driver's license data of three in four U.S. adults and could locate the same number through their public utility records.\n\n\"These data intensive tools aggregate all of these data points and create associations,\" said Emerald Tse, an associate at Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology. \" can implicate the people in your household, your neighbors, your workplace, literally every aspect of your life.\"\n\nThat aggregated data is pumped into algorithms that help decide who ICE should detain, whether to release a person from detention or determine the terms of their electronic surveillance, experts say.\n\nImmigration agencies are growing in reach as well. Another Trump executive order encourages the use of what are called 287(g) agreements that allow the DHS to deputize local law enforcement to act as federal immigration officers.\n\nThis gives local authorities full access to the AI tools that ICE uses, along with all the private data those tools have gathered. That means thousands more immigration agents are handling private data and hunting the people that data implicates.\n\n\"That's where I see a ramp up,\" said Hussain. \"The feds have their technology, and locals have their technology. There'll be a lot of sharing of that information and whatever data the technology is able to collect.\"",

Hamilton Police is investigating the homicide that happened Wednesday, saying Randhawa was an innocent bystander.\n\nThe Consulate General of India in Toronto said in a post on X Friday, \"We are deeply saddened by the tragic death of Indian student Harsimrat Randhawa in Hamilton, Ontario.\"\n\nThe official added, \"As per local police, she was an innocent victim, fatally struck by a stray bullet during a shooting incident involving two vehicles.

Iran's utmost authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said this week he was \"neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic\".\n\nAlso Read | Iran FM says has ‘serious doubts’ over US intentions ahead of talks\n\nFor his part, Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday, \"I'm for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can't have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.\"\n\nMr. Trump, who ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six powers during his first term in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on Tehran, has revived his \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Iran since returning to the White House in January.\n\nWashington wants Iran to halt production of highly enriched uranium, which it believes is aimed at building an atomic bomb.\n\nTehran, which has always said its nuclear programme is peaceful, says it is willing to negotiate some curbs in return for the lifting of sanctions, but wants watertight guarantees that Washington will not renege again as Trump did in 2018.\n\nSince 2019, Iran has breached and far surpassed the 2015 deal's limits on its uranium enrichment, producing stocks far above what the West says is necessary for a civilian energy programme.\n\nA senior Iranian official, who described Iran's negotiating position on condition of anonymity, listed Iran's red lines as never agreeing to dismantle its uranium enriching centrifuges, halt enrichment altogether or reduce its enriched uranium stockpile below levels agreed in the 2015 deal. Iran also rejects negotiating about defence capabilities such as missiles.\n\nWhile both Tehran and Washington have said they are set on pursuing diplomacy, there is still a wide gap between them on the dispute that has rumbled on for more than two decades.\n\nWitkoff and Araqchi interacted briefly at the end of the first round last week, but officials from the two countries have not held direct negotiations since 2015, and Iran said the Rome talks would also be held indirectly through the Omani mediators.\n\nRussia, a party to Iran's 2015 nuclear agreement, has offered \"to assist, mediate, and play any role\" that will be beneficial to Iran and the United States.",

    "content": "The White House on Friday (April 19, 2025) unveiled a revamped COVID-19 website that promoted the contentious theory that the virus leaked from a Chinese laboratory, framing it as the pandemic's \"true origins.\"\n\nThe Covid.gov website, previously focused on promoting vaccine and testing information, now includes a full-length image of President Donald Trump and criticizes the pandemic policies implemented under former president Joe Biden.\n\nThe site also targets Anthony Fauci, Biden's former chief medical advisor, for advancing what it calls the \"preferred narrative that Covid-19 originated naturally.\"\n\nIt presents five bullet points aimed at bolstering the lab leak theory, noting that Wuhan, the site of the first known coronavirus case, is also home to China's \"foremost SARS research lab\" and has a history of conducting research at \"inadequate biosafety levels.\"\n\n\"By nearly all measures of science, if there was evidence of a natural origin it would have already surfaced. But it hasn't,\" the website said.\n\nThe lab-leak theory, once dismissed as a conspiracy theory, has recently gained mainstream traction in the United States.\n\nEven as the debate remains unresolved -- scientifically and politically -- US agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Energy have come out in support of the theory, albeit with varying levels of confidence.\n\nEarlier this year, the Central Intelligence Agency shifted its official stance on the virus's origin, saying that it was \"more likely\" leaked from a Chinese lab than transmission from animals.\n\nThe assessment drew criticism from China, which said it was \"extremely unlikely\" that Covid-19 came from a laboratory. Beijing also urged the United States to \"stop politicizing and instrumentalizing the issue of origin-tracing.\"\n\nThe United States and China are currently locked in a major trade war, with Washington announcing Thursday new port fees for Chinese-linked ships and increased tariffs for Chinese goods.\n\n'Terrible shame'\n\n\"I welcome all efforts to dig deeper,\" said Jamie Metzl, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in response to the revamped White House website.\n\n\"But it would be a terrible shame if such efforts distracted from essential work to help prevent further infections and treat people suffering from Covid-19 and long Covid,\" he told NPR.\n\nThe new site, which apparently seeks to redefine the political narrative about Covid-19, also criticized the mask and social distancing mandates introduced at the start of the pandemic in 2020. There is also a map of Wuhan that is animated to throb.\n\nUnder a section titled \"Covid-19 misinformation,\" it also accused public health officials under the previous administration of demonizing \"alternative treatments\" and colluding with social media companies to censor dissenting views about the pandemic -- a charge frequently echoed by US conservatives.\n\nThe Biden administration has previously rejected the charge that it was suppressing or censoring conservative perspectives.\n\nThe website revamp comes after layoffs began earlier this month at major U.S. health agencies, as the Trump administration embarks on a sweeping and scientifically contested restructuring that will cut 10,000 jobs.\n\nHealth secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr -- who has alarmed health experts with his rhetoric downplaying the importance of vaccines -- said the layoffs were part of a major reform of his department, aiming to refocus efforts on chronic disease prevention.\n\nMore than one million people died of Covid-19 and related illnesses in the United States, and millions more fell victim to the disease around the world.",

Joe Biden, said the policy reflected a reversal of more than 30 years of practice at the State Department of allowing people to update the sex designation on their passports.\n\nIn 2022, the Biden administration allowed passport applicants to choose \"X\" as a neutral sex marker on their passport applications, as well as being able to self-select \"M\" or \"F\" for male or female.",

Several of them are charred,\" Ms. Lokumu told AFP.\n\nJoseph Lokondo, a local civil society leader who said he helped bury the bodies, put the \"provisional death toll at 145: some burned, others drowned\".\n\nMs. Lokumu said the blaze was caused by a fuel explosion ignited by an onboard cooking fire.\n\n\"A woman lit the embers for cooking. The fuel, which was not far away, exploded, killing many children and women\", she said.\n\nMissing loved ones\n\nThe total number of passengers on board the doomed vessel was not known but Lokumu said it was in the \"hundreds\".

Estimates then were that Schedule F could make at least 50,000 federal workers vulnerable to being fired.\n\nThe new order is broad enough that hundreds of thousands of people could be reclassified, Moynihan said, before firings begin.\n\nOver 260,000 federal workers have already been fired, taken buyouts, retired early or have been earmarked for termination since Trump took office, according to a tally by Reuters.\n\nThe reclassification comes as Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency continue their drive to cut the size and cost of the federal workforce. They claim it is bloated and full of waste and fraud.\n\nEverett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the biggest federal workers' union with 800,000 members, decried the move by Trump.\n\n“President Trump’s action to politicize the work of tens of thousands of career federal employees will erode the government’s merit-based hiring system and undermine the professional civil service that Americans rely on,\" Mr. Kelley said.",

    "content": "The dispute over the wrongful deportation and imprisonment of Kilmar Abrego Garcia “is not only about one man” but about Donald Trump's disregard of the American judicial system as well, Sen. Chris Van Hollen said Friday as he returned from a three-day trip to El Salvador to press for the detained man's release.\n\nSpeaking to reporters just after landing back in the United States, Mr. Van Hollen offered few answers about what will come next in Abrego Garcia’s case. But the Maryland Democrat said that he and others will keep speaking out after the Trump administration defied court orders to facilitate his return to the United States and insisted that he would stay in El Salvador — even as officials acknowledged an “error” in deporting him.\n\n“It’s about protecting the constitutional rights of everybody who resides in the United States,” Mr. Van Hollen said at Washington Dulles International Airport at a news conference with Abrego Garcia's supporters behind him. “It’s very clear that the president, Trump administration, are blatantly, flagrantly disagreeing with, defying the order from the Supreme Court.”\n\nStanding next to him, Mr. Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer, wiped away tears as the Senator shared her husband’s comments about missing his family.\n\nMuch uncertainty remains about the future of Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran citizen who was living in Maryland, after Mr. Van Hollen was presented with a carefully staged opportunity to meet with him in El Salvador on Thursday. The Maryland Senator said that Mr. Abrego Garcia reported he'd been moved from a notorious Salvadoran mega-prison, CECOT, to a detention center with better conditions\n\nMr. Abrego Garcia's status after Van Hollen left was not known, and there was no indication that Mr. Van Hollen’s trip pushed him any closer to release.\n\nThe case has become a focal point in the national immigration debate. Democrats insist that President Donald Trump is overstepping his executive authority and disrespecting the courts; Republicans are criticizing Democrats for defending a man Trump and White House officials claim is an MS-13 gang member, despite the fact that he has not been charged with any gang-related crimes.\n\nMr. Van Hollen said that Mr. Abrego Garcia told him that he'd shared a cell with 25 prisoners and was afraid of many fellow inmates at CECOT before he was moved to another center in Santa Ana, El Salvador. He said that Mr. Abrego Garcia reported being treated well — but noted that they were surrounded by government minders at the time.\n\nThe fight over Mr. Abrego Garcia is the latest partisan flashpoint as Democrats struggle to break through and push back during the opening few months of Trump’s second administration.\n\nMore Democratic lawmakers have said they will fly to El Salvador to push for Abrego Garcia’s release, but the partisan pressure has yielded no results. President Donald Trump and El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, have only dug in on keeping him out of the United States. That stance remained even after the U.S. Supreme Court called on the administration to facilitate his return.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said that Mr. Abrego Garcia will “never live in the United States of America again.”\n\nBukele posted images of Mr. Van Hollen’s meeting with Mr. Abrego Garcia on Thursday and said that the prisoner “gets the honor of staying in El Salvador’s custody.” Mr. Van Hollen said a Salvadoran government official placed other beverages on the table with salt or sugar on the rim to make it appear they were drinking margaritas. Mr. Van Hollen said neither he nor Mr. Abrego Garcia drank from the glasses, which in the photo Bukele posted were garnished with cherries.\n\nAfter days of denying that he knew much about Mr. Abrego Garcia, Mr. Trump on Friday said he knew Mr. Abrego Garcia's prison record was “unbelievably bad” and called him an “illegal alien” and a “foreign terrorist.”\n\nThe President also responded Friday with a social media post saying Van Hollen “looked like a fool yesterday standing in El Salvador begging for attention.”\n\nSeveral House Republicans have visited the notorious gang prison in support of the Trump administration’s efforts. Rep. Riley Moore, a West Virginia Republican, posted Tuesday evening that he’d visited the prison where Abrego Garcia is being held. “I leave now even more determined to support President Trump’s efforts to secure our homeland,” Moore wrote on social media.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials acknowledged in a court filing earlier this month that Abrego Garcia's deportation was an “ administrative error.” The government’s acknowledgment generated immediate uproar from immigration advocates, but White House officials have stuck with the allegation that he’s a gang member.\n\nThe fight has also played out in contentious court filings, with repeated refusals from the government to tell a judge what it plans to do, if anything, to repatriate him.\n\nThe three-judge panel from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously refused Thursday to suspend the judge’s decision to order sworn testimony by Trump administration officials and said the judiciary will be hurt by the “constant intimations of its illegitimacy” while the executive branch “will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness.”\n\nJudge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, nominated by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, wrote that he and his two colleagues “cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.”\n\nSince March, El Salvador has accepted from the United States more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes. Bukele's government has placed them inside the country’s maximum-security gang prison, just outside San Salvador.",

    "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-top-courts-definition-of-woman-further-polarises-debate-on-gender/article69464919.ece",
    "content": "On April 16, the U.K.’s Supreme Court unanimously ruled that only biological women and not transwomen meet the definition of a woman under equality laws. The central question in For Women Scotland Ltd. (Appellant) vs The Scottish Ministers (Respondent) was “whether the Equality Act 2010 treats a transwoman with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) as a woman for all purposes within the scope of its provisions, or when that Act speaks of a ‘woman’ and ‘sex’, it is referring to a biological woman and biological sex”.\n\nThe ruling\n\nIn an 88-page judgment, the five judges – three men (Lord Reed, President Lord Hodge, Deputy President Lord Lloyd-Jones) and two women (Lady Rose, Lady Simler) – held that they wanted to address the “meaning of the words” which Parliament used in EA 2010 in “legislating to protect women and members of the trans community against discrimination.” It said that among the people whom the EA 2010 recognises as having protected characteristics are women, whose “protected” characteristic is sex, and “transsexual” people, whose “protected” characteristic is gender reassignment. After hearing both the appellant and the respondent, and experts and activists, Britain’s highest court gave its “statutory interpretation” that the terms ‘woman’ and ‘sex’ in the EA 2010 refer only to a biological woman and biological sex.\n\nTrans rights\n\nTrans supporters and campaigners worry that the ruling is a setback for trans inclusion. Jane Fae, director of the campaign group TransActual, told The Guardian, that the ruling had stripped away protections for trans people to the “bare minimum, by reducing the legal protections only to cases involving harassment, discrimination or equal pay”. Kishwer Falkner, the chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), added to the fears of the trans community by saying that the court’s judgment meant only “biological women could use single-sex changing rooms and women’s toilets, or participate in women-only sporting events and teams, or be placed in women’s wards in hospitals.” Many trans people who have undergone gender reassignment admit that the toilet issue — should transwomen be allowed in women-only spaces? — needs to be sorted out. The judges counselled against reading the judgment as a triumph for one or more groups in society at the expense of another —“it is not,” Justice Hodge told the media. The judges are of the view that the Gender Recognition Act 2004 continues to provide legal recognition of the rights of transgender people, which has practical effects for individual rights and freedoms “(including, for example, in the context of marriage, pensions, retirement and social security).” Transgender people, the ruling noted, are also protected by the indirect discrimination provisions of the EA 2010 “without the need for a certificated sex reading of the EA 2010”.\n\nGender laws\n\nThe movement to change transgender laws has ebbed in Scotland after the exit of Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon. She suddenly resigned in 2023, but not before getting a lot of criticism for her plans to change gender laws so that those with gender recognition certificates could be entitled to the same protections as biological women. The Scottish government said it accepted the judgment and protection of rights of all groups would underpin future moves. For Women Scotland, who appealed against the Scottish government’s plans, said it was vindicated because it had argued that only biological women should be entitled to rights for women.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Commission uses the term ‘transgender’ as an umbrella term to describe people whose sense of their own gender is different to their sex at birth. Human rights abuses against transgender people include violence, discrimination (the hijra community in India is ghettoised and struggles to get health care or education or housing), lack of legal recognition of their identity and harassment. Trans people are often branded as ill, “pathologised”, but being different, says the UN, should not be treated as a disorder. The UN has highlighted that pathologisation is one of the root causes of human rights violations faced by trans people.\n\nIn countries around the world, there has been an increasing decimation of rights for people who do not fit into the binary of male and female. In Hungary, for example, a wider crackdown on the LGBTQIA+ community impacted transgender people with the government stating that there are two sexes, male and female, and that legal norms are based on “biological reality”. President Donald Trump of the U.S. signed an executive order banning transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports – a hotly debated, divisive topic.\n\nThe ruling will have an impact on sport where athletics, cycling and aquatics have already banned transgender women from participating in women’s events. Reuters reported that the English Football Association has introduced stricter rules, but still allows transgender women in the women’s game as long as their testosterone was kept below a certain level. These norms are likely to change after the ruling.\n\nIn the U.S., Mr. Trump has also signed orders saying the government recognises only two sexes: male and female. Experts say “gender is a spectrum, not a binary structure”. India passed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act in 2019, which defines a transperson as someone whose gender does not match the one assigned at birth. It prohibits discrimination against them in employment, education, housing, healthcare and other services. But the community was aghast at some of the clauses, including a mandate that each person would have to be recognised as “transgender” on the basis of a certificate of identity issued by a district magistrate. This overlooked a recommendation by the 2016 Standing Committee to have a screening committee. If the district magistrate refused to hand out such a certificate, there was no scope for an appeal or redressal. The demand from trans people has always been that any legal framework should factor in suggestions from the community.",

    "content": "A U.S. airstrike on an important oil port held by Yemen's Houthi rebels killed more than 70 people and wounded many others, the Iranian-backed rebel group said Friday, marking a major escalation in the military campaign President Donald Trump launched against the faction last month.\n\nThe overnight strike on the Ras Isa port sent massive fireballs billowing skyward and turned tanker trucks into burning wrecks. It was the first American attack on a Houthi-controlled oil facility since the U.S. began its new bombing campaign. It also came just before the resumption of negotiations in Rome between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, which Washington has linked to its Yemen campaign.\n\nThe U.S. is targeting the Houthis because of the group's attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a crucial global trade route, and on Israel. The Houthis are the last militant group in Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” that is capable of regularly attacking Israel.\n\nThe port serves as a major hub for incoming fuel shipments that power areas of Yemen held by the Houthis, and analysts say the airstrike could seriously affect daily life there.\n\nThe Houthis, who said the attack killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, aired graphic footage of the aftermath on their al-Masirah satellite news channel, showing corpses strewn about the port and smashed tanker trucks. They denounced the strike as a “completely unjustified aggression.”\n\n“It targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades,” the group said in a statement.\n\nU.S. Central Command declined to answer any questions about possible civilian casualties but referred to a statement in which it said “this strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen.”\n\n“U.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years,” it said in its statement.\n\nA U.S. official said the attack sent a message to those supplying fuel to the Houthis despite sanctions. The official spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public.\n\nHours after the U.S. strike, the Houthis launched a missile toward Israel that was intercepted, the Israeli military said. Sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and elsewhere. Meanwhile, the Houthis said they shot down another American MQ-9 Predator drone, which the U.S. official acknowledged.\n\nThe Ras Isa port is a collection of oil tanks and equipment that sits in Yemen's Hodeida governorate along the Red Sea. It is just off Kamaran Island, which has been targeted by intense U.S. airstrikes in recent days.\n\nBefore the Houthis took control of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in 2014 and sent the government into exile, oil from the country’s energy-rich Marib governorate moved through Ras Isa for export. But since the Houthis don’t control that region, the port now serves as an import hub for gasoline, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas that help power those parts of Yemen the Houthis control.\n\nThe new U.S. operation against the Houthis under Trump appears more extensive than attacks on the group were under President Joe Biden, an AP review found. The new campaign started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” ships again over Israel blocking aid from entering the Gaza Strip.\n\nFrom November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.\n\nAssessing the toll of the month-old U.S. airstrike campaign has been difficult because the military hasn’t released information about the attacks, including what was targeted and how many people were killed. The Houthis, meanwhile, strictly control access to attacked areas and don’t publish complete information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites.\n\nThe Ras Isa port airstrike is the deadliest known attack yet in the month-old campaign. The actual cost in lives is hard to assess, said Luca Nevola, the senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a think tank.\n\n“Since they are targeting civilian areas, there’s a lot more victims. But it’s also difficult to assess how many because the Houthis are releasing these umbrella statements that cover all the victims ... or tend to stress only the civilian victims,” Nevola said.\n\nFurther complicating the situation is the U.S. strikes hitting military targets, said Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert at the Basha Report risk advisory firm. He pointed to an American attack that Trump highlighted online with black-and-white strike footage, which might have killed about 70 fighters.\n\n“Although the Houthis claimed it was a tribal gathering, they neither released any footage nor named a single casualty, strongly suggesting the victims were not civilians but affiliated fighters,” al-Basha said. “However, the overnight strike on the Ras Isa Fuel Port marks the first mass-casualty incident the Houthis have openly acknowledged and publicized.”\n\nThe AP analyzed satellite images of the port provided by Planet Labs PBC that showed destroyed oil tanks and vehicles, and what appeared to be oil leaking into the Red Sea.\n\nWim Zwijnenburg, an analyst with Dutch peace organization PAX, said it appeared at least three fuel storage tanks had been destroyed and that oil had leaked from mooring pipelines.\n\nA U.S. State Department spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, accused a Chinese commercial satellite image provider, Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd., of “directly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests.”\n\nDuring a briefing with reporters, Bruce did not elaborate in detail. But she acknowledged a report by The Financial Times that quoted anonymous American officials saying the company linked to the People’s Liberation Army has provided images allowing the rebels to target U.S. warships and commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea corridor.\n\nBruce said “Beijing's support\" of the satellite company ... “contradicts their claims of being peace supporters.”\n\nResponding to a question about the allegation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Friday: “I am not familiar with the situation you mentioned.\" However, he insisted China is seen as urging countries “to make more efforts conducive to regional peace and stability.”\n\n“Since the escalations in the Red Sea situation, China has been playing a positive role in de-escalating the situation,” Lin said. “Who is promoting talks for peace and deescalating the tensions, and who is imposing sanctions and pressure?”\n\nThe company didn't respond to request for comment. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned it in 2023 for allegedly providing satellite images to the Russian mercenary force the Wagner Group as it fought in Ukraine.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Chang Guang is linked to the Chinese government. The U.S. government in the past has used images taken by American commercial satellite companies to share with allies, like Ukraine, to avoid releasing its own top-secret pictures.",

    "content": "A class action lawsuit filed Friday asks a federal court to reinstate the legal status of international students caught up in a Trump administration crackdown that has left more than a thousand fearful of deportation.\n\nThe suit filed by several American Civil Liberties Union affiliates seeks to represent more than 100 students in New England and Puerto Rico.\n\n\"International students are a vital community in our state’s universities, and no administration should be allowed to circumvent the law to unilaterally strip students of status, disrupt their studies, and put them at risk of deportation,” said Gilles Bissonnette, legal director of the ACLU of New Hampshire.\n\nAt schools around the country, students have seen their visas revoked or their legal status terminated, typically with little notice.\n\nAbout 1,100 students at more than 170 colleges, universities and university systems have been affected since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements, correspondence with school officials and court records. The AP is working to confirm reports of hundreds more students affected.\n\nStudents have filed other lawsuits arguing they were denied due process. Federal judges have granted temporary restraining orders in New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Montana, shielding students from efforts to remove them from the U.S.\n\nPlaintiffs in the new lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Hampshire, learned without warning their F-1 student statuses had been terminated, leaving in doubt their ability to stay in the country and finish their studies, according to the complaint.\n\nOne of them, Manikanta Pasula of India, was on the brink of getting his master’s in computer science at Rivier University in New Hampshire and applying to remain in the country through a work program for international students.

Now, he cannot work as a research assistant, which was his only source of income, the complaint said.\n\nThe government did not give notice it is required to provide before terminating a foreign student’s legal status, the lawyers said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nLast month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department was revoking visas held by visitors who were acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel’s war in Gaza and those who face criminal charges.\n\nIn some high-profile cases, such as that involving Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, the Trump administration has cited involvement in pro-Palestinian activism as a rationale for deportation.\n\nBut colleges say most students affected by visa revocations played no role in those protests. Many are being singled out over minor infractions such as traffic violations that occurred long ago, and in some cases the reason is unclear, colleges say.",

    "content": "Two U.S. Congress members landed in Damascus on Friday (April 18, 2025) to meet Syrian officials, the first visit by American lawmakers to the war-ravaged country since Bashar al-Assad was ousted from power by an Islamist-led rebel offensive in December.\n\nThe two are U.S. Representatives Cory Mills of Florida, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services committees, and Marlin Stutzman of Indiana. Both are members of President Donald Trump's Republican Party.\n\nMr. Mills met new Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Friday night, said a person in the delegation. They discussed U.S. sanctions and Iran during a 90-minute meeting.\n\nThe source said Mr. Stutzman was set to meet on Saturday with Sharaa, still under U.S. and UN sanctions for his previous ties to al Qaeda.\n\nAsked about meeting a leader still sanctioned by Washington, Mr. Stutzman cited examples of Trump’s administration engaging with Iranian and North Korean leaders.\n\n“We shouldn’t be afraid to talk to anybody,” he said, and said he was eager to see how Syria would deal with foreign fighters and rule the country’s diverse population inclusively.\n\nSyria’s new Islamist-led leadership has pushed for the U.S. and Europe to fully lift sanctions so the country can kickstart an economy decimated by more than a decade of war.\n\nMr. Mills and Mr. Stutzman toured parts of the Syrian capital destroyed by the war, met with Christian religious leaders and plan to meet other Syrian government ministers.\n\n“There’s an opportunity here - these opportunities come around once in a lifetime,” Mr. Stutzman told Reuters. “I don’t want Syria pushed into the arms of China, or back into the arms of Russia and Iran.”\n\nLast month the U.S. gave Syria a list of conditions to fulfil in exchange for partial sanctions relief – including removing foreign fighters from leadership roles - but the Trump administration has otherwise engaged little with the new rulers.\n\nThe Congressmen’s visit was organized by the Syrian American Alliance for Peace and Prosperity.\n\nMr. Stutzman said Syrians in Damascus spoke to him about Israel’s strikes on the country, which have targeted military sites in the south as well as around the capital. Israel has also sent ground troops into parts of southern Syria, and has lobbied the U.S. to keep Syria weak and decentralized.\n\n“My hope is that a strong government is established in Syria that is supportive of the people of Syria, and the people of Syria support the government - and that the relationship between Israel and Syria can be a strong relationship. I think that’s possible, honestly I do,” he said.",

    "content": "About 10,000 pages of records related to the 1968 assassination of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy were released Friday (April 18, 2025), including handwritten notes by the gunman, who said the Democratic presidential candidate “must be disposed of” and acknowledged an obsession with killing him.\n\nMany of the files had been made public previously, but others had not been digitized and sat for decades in federal government storage facilities. Their release continued the disclosure of national secrets ordered by President Donald Trump.\n\nKennedy was fatally shot on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles moments after giving a speech celebrating his victory in California’s presidential primary. His assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, was convicted of first-degree murder and is serving life in prison.\n\nThe files included pictures of handwritten notes by Sirhan.\n\n“RFK must be disposed of like his brother was,” read the writing on the outside of an empty envelope with the return address from the district director of the Internal Revenue Service in Los Angeles.\n\nSirhan also filled a page of a Pasadena City College notebook with variations of “R.F.K must die” and “R.F.K must be killed.” In a note dated May 18, 1968, he wrote: “My determination to eliminate R.F.K. is becoming more of an unshakable obsession.”\n\nIn another of the newly released documents, the assassin said he advocated for “the overthrow of the current president.” Democrat Lyndon Johnson was in the White House at the time of RFK's death.\n\n“I have no absolute plans yet, but soon will compose them,” wrote Sirhan, who pledged support for communist Russia and China.\n\nThe newly released files also included notes from interviews with people who knew Sirhan from a wide variety of contexts, such as classmates, neighbors and coworkers. While some described him as “a friendly, kind and generous person” others depicted a brooding and “impressionable” young man who felt strongly about his political convictions and briefly believed in mysticism.\n\nAccording to the files, Sirhan told his garbage collector that he planned to kill Kennedy shortly after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968. The sanitation worker, a Black man, said he planned to vote for Kennedy because he would help Black people.\n\n“Well, I don’t agree. I am planning on shooting the son of a bitch,” Sirhan replied, the man told investigators.\n\nFBI documents describe interviews with a group of tourists who had heard rumors about Kennedy being shot weeks before his death. Several people who visited Israel in May 1968 said a tour guide told them Kennedy had been shot. One person said he heard that an attempt on Kennedy’s life had been made in Milwaukee. Another heard that he was shot in Nebraska.\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration posted 229 files containing the pages to its public website.\n\nThe release comes a month after unredacted files related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy were disclosed. Those documents gave curious readers more details about Cold War-era covert U.S. operations in other nations but did not initially lend credence to long-circulating conspiracy theories about who killed JFK.\n\nTrump, a Republican, has championed in the name of transparency the release of documents related to high-profile assassinations and investigations. But he’s also been deeply suspicious for years of the government’s intelligence agencies. His administration’s release of once-hidden files opens the door for additional public scrutiny and questions about the operations and conclusions of institutions such as the CIA and the FBI.\n\nTrump signed an executive order in January calling for the release of government documents related to the assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and King, who were killed within two months of each other.\n\nLawyers for Kennedy's killer have said for decades that he is unlikely to reoffend or pose a danger to society, and in 2021, a parole board deemed Sirhan suitable for release. But Gov. Gavin Newson rejected the decision in 2022, keeping him in state prison. In 2023 , a different panel denied him release, saying he still lacks insight into what caused him to shoot Kennedy.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a son of the New York senator who now serves as health and human services secretary, commended Trump and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, for their “courage” and “dogged efforts” to release the files.\n\n“Lifting the veil on the RFK papers is a necessary step toward restoring trust in American government,” the health secretary said in a statement.",

He also skipped the Colosseum event, which often takes place in cooler Spring weather, in 2023 and 2024.\n\nThe Vatican said Francis had personally written the meditations for the ceremony this year, for the second time in his 12-year papacy.\n\nThe reflections, each starting with a brief Bible reading, were short and addressed themes including war, economic difficulties, and the place of women in the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Vatican has not yet said whether Francis will attend other Easter services over the weekend.\n\nThe pope also skipped an earlier ceremony at the Vatican on Thursday. U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his family, visiting Italy for Easter, were among attendees at that event.",

    "content": "President Donald Trump on Friday said negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are “coming to a head” and insisted that neither side is “playing” him in his push to end the grinding war.\n\nMr. Trump spoke shortly after Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the U.S. may “move on” from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days, after months of efforts have failed to bring an end to the fighting.\n\n“Now, if for some reason, one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we’re just going to say you’re foolish. You are fools, you horrible people,” Mr. Trump said. “And we’re going to just take a pass. But hopefully, we won’t have to do that.”\n\nMr. Rubio's dour assessment came after landmark talks in Paris among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress. Another meeting is expected next week in London, and Rubio suggested it could be decisive in determining whether the Trump administration continues its involvement.\n\n“We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,” Mr. Rubio told reporters in Paris. “Because if it’s not, then I think we’re just going to move on. It’s not our war. We have other priorities to focus on.”\n\nHe said the U.S. administration wants to decide “in a matter of days.”\n\nThe State Department said Mr. Rubio issued the same warning in a phone call Friday with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, telling him that “if a clear path to peace does not emerge soon, the United States will step back from efforts to broker peace.”\n\nMr. Trump said “Marco is right” that the dynamic of the negotiations must change, but stopped short of saying he's ready to walk away.\n\n“Well, I don’t want to say that,” Mr. Trump said. “But we want to see it end.”\n\nMr. Rubio’s comments stepped up pressure on both sides to reach a peace deal, even as the U.S. and Ukraine made progress on a minerals agreement that Trump has sought to recoup billions of dollars in military assistance that Washington has sent Kyiv since Russia’s full scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nThey also indicated the road to a complete truce will be long and mired with contention, despite Trump repeatedly claiming on the campaign trail that he could end the war within a day. Trump said last month that he was “being a little bit sarcastic.”\n\nComing out of the Paris talks, the Americans are ready to use both carrot and stick strategies with Russia and understand the need for ″a relationship of force that allows them to get commitments from both sides,\" said a French diplomatic official who took part in the talks but was not authorized to comment publicly.\n\nThe Americans and Europeans discussed sanctions but ″not the question of easing sanctions\" on Russia. The official said the European Union needs to use ″all instruments at our disposition,\" notably to have levers of influence over the Russians to ensure they commit to eventual promises.\n\nU.S. Vice President JD Vance struck a more hopeful tone in Rome on Friday, ahead of talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.\n\n“We think we have some interesting things to report on, of course in private,” he said. On the negotiations, “I won’t prejudge them, but we do feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war, to a close.”\n\nHe didn’t give more details.\n\nThe U.S. and Ukraine are nearing a long-delayed deal granting the U.S. access to Ukraine’s vast mineral resources, which has been intertwined with Trump's peace push. Trump said Thursday: \"We have a minerals deal.'' Ukraine's economy minister said Friday that the two countries signed a memorandum of intent ahead of a possible fuller agreement later.\n\nThe deal, which Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said she signed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is expected to pave the way for significant investments, infrastructure modernization and long-term cooperation.\n\nThe framework of the mineral deal had stalled in February following a contentious Oval Office meeting between Trump, Vance and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nDespite apparent impatience with the peace efforts, Rubio called Thursday’s Paris talks constructive. He said he informed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the outlines that emerged, but wouldn’t say how Lavrov reacted.\n\nWhen asked about Mr. Rubio’s comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that “fairly complex” negotiations are ongoing between Russia and the U.S. He did not give details.\n\n“Russia is striving toward resolving this conflict, securing its own interests, and is open to dialogue. We are continuing to do this,” he said.\n\nPeskov stressed that a limited, 30-day ceasefire backed by Washington that both Russia and Ukraine last month embraced in principle has now lapsed, but did not say what steps Moscow might take next.\n\nWhile voicing their readiness to implement the agreement, the warring parties issued conflicting statements soon after their separate talks with U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia. They differed on the start time of halting strikes, and alleged near-immediate breaches by the other side.\n\nAfter weeks of tensions with European allies, Rubio said the European negotiators proved helpful. \"The U.K. and France and Germany can help us move the ball on this.\"\n\nEuropean concerns are growing about Trump’s readiness to draw closer to Russia. The talks in Paris were the first time since Trump’s inauguration that top American, Ukrainian and European officials met to discuss an end to the war, which has posed the biggest security challenge to Europe since World War II.\n\nThe meetings addressed security guarantees for Ukraine in the future, but Rubio wouldn’t discuss any possible U.S. role in that. Some kind of U.S. support for Ukraine is seen as crucial to ensuring that Russia would not attack again after a peace deal is reached.\n\nMr. Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace, and Witkoff has met three times with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr. Rubio said. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMoscow has effectively refused to accept a separate, comprehensive ceasefire that Mr. Trump has pushed and Ukraine has endorsed. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine’s mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine.\n\nAsked if Mr. Putin was dragging his feet on negotiations, Mr. Trump replied, “I hope not. We'll know about that soon if he is.\"\n\nThomas Wright, a former National Security Council adviser closely involved in the Biden administration’s efforts on the war, said Trump's approach to the negotiations “was sort of remarkable” for putting all the pressure for concessions on Ukraine. It suggests, he said, that Trump might want to “sidestep the war” and move forward to deepen ties with Russia.\n\nMr. Wright said if the Mr. Trump administration were to pull support from Ukraine, it would help Russia but it wouldn't end the war.\n\n“The only way to bring the war to an end is to somehow increase pressure on Putin to negotiate seriously,' said Wright, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. \"And the only way you can really do that is by ... maintaining and intensifying support for Ukraine on the battlefield.”\n\nMeanwhile, Russia kept up its deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities, wounding scores of civilians days after missiles killed at least 34 during Palm Sunday celebrations in the northern city of Sumy.\n\nOne person died and 98 others, including six children, were hurt as Russia hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, on Friday, its mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. He said cluster munitions struck a densely populated neighborhood four times.\n\nRussian drones also targeted a bakery in Sumy, less than a week after the deadly Palm Sunday strike there, killing a customer and wounding an employee, the regional prosecutor's office said. Photos released by the agency showed rows of Easter cakes stacked inside a devastated building, covered in thick dust, as a huge hole gaped in the wall behind them and rubble piled up on the floor.\n\nLast Sunday’s strike on Sumy, resulting in mass casualties, was the second large-scale missile attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week. Some 20 people, including nine children, died on April 4 as missiles struck Zelenskyy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih.",

    "content": "If a decision is made on expanding the UN Security Council, \"then surely\" India will be a contender, Chair of Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN) on UNSC reforms on Thursday said.\n\n\"The goal of this reformed Council must be representative. Obviously, India is a main player on the world stage today. But it [UN] is a membership of 193 countries. The consideration is representative for everybody and the whole membership of the United Nations,\" Ambassador Tareq AlBanai said at a press briefing here.\n\n\"So surely, if the decision is made that expansion of the Council goes to from anywhere from 21 to 27 members, then surely India will be a contender in that and will be subject to the decision of the wider membership,\" Mr. AlBanai said in response to a question by PTI.\n\nMr. AlBanai, who is Kuwait's Permanent Representative to the UN, recalled that last year he and co-Chair Ambassador Alexander Marschik of Austria had visited India and had a conversation there \"at the highest level\" on the issue of UNSC reform.\n\nUpdating on the progress made in the IGN process during the current 79th UNGA session, the ambassador said while the road to reform is “undeniably complex, we are taking steady and meaningful steps toward the path forward”.\n\nHe noted that aside from an increase in the number of elected members in 1965, the first iteration of the Security Council has lasted over 80 years. \"Whatever formulation the reformed Council takes, it must be designed to endure for the next century, anchored in the principles of inclusivity, transparency, efficiency, effectiveness, democracy and accountability.\"\n\nResponding to a question on how many members an expanded UNSC must have, he said there is no decision yet but the numbers being floated range between 21 and 27 member states.\n\nTo a question on text-based negotiations, Mr. AlBanai noted that India's position has always been to move towards text-based negotiations as soon as possible. \"Obviously, this process will lead us to text-based negotiations\" as that is the \"least complicated\" part of this process.\n\n\"The most complicated part is to have consent on what that text contains, and then putting it on paper is not really going to be that difficult… Do we have consensus? Yes, we have consensus on many issues regarding the five clusters, many issues of convergence that we have been able to put together over all those many years. There are still some issues of contention, but we are working steadily and surely to make sure that we overcome those,\" Mr. AlBanai said.\n\nThe five issues are categories of membership, question of the veto, regional representation, size of an enlarged Security Council, and working methods of the Council, and relationship between the Council and the General Assembly.\n\nMr. AlBanai said he is \"encouraged\" by the momentum shown by the Member States in this session. \"The spirit of reform requires both courage and creativity, and the active engagement of all delegations remains essential as we work to find consensus on core elements of Security Council reform.\"\n\nEarlier this week, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador, P. Harish, in a statement on behalf of the G4 nations of Brazil, Germany, Japan, and India, told an IGN meeting that the existing UN architecture is from a different era, one that no longer exists and the current geopolitical realities warrant a review of this architecture.\n\nMr. Harish said Security Council membership needs to be increased from the current 15 to 25 or 26, with a reformed Council consisting of 11 permanent members and 14 or 15 non-permanent members.\n\nAt present, the powerful UN organ consists of five veto-wielding permanent members -- China, France, Russia, U.K., and the U.S. The remaining 10 members are elected to sit at the horse-shoe table for two-year terms as non-permanent members. India last sat in the Council as a non-permanent member in 2021-22.\n\nThe G4 nations have also encouraged Member States to submit further model of reforms in order to facilitate text-based negotiations. \"We invite the Chair to start text-based negotiations now, ideally by the end of the current IGN,\" the group has said.\n\nMr. AlBanai and Mr. Marschik last February met External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, who in a post on X said he “appreciated their assessment of the ongoing discussions on UNSC reform”. “The international community hopes that under their stewardship the IGN process moves forward this year,” he posted online.\n\nAfter the meeting, Kuwait's Permanent Mission had on X said that both sides discussed ongoing developments with regards to the reform process, and ways in which it could be further developed.\n\n\"The co-chairs thanked India's Minister of External Affairs for the generous invitation, and commended India's commitment to this vital process,\" the Mission said.\n\nMr. AlBanai, however, said he could not tell whether the reform would take place by 2030 or any other year.\n\n“I’m very positive about breaking down whatever barriers there are because people are understanding that we need something different and Member States are understanding that this is the recourse of the world community to tackle all issues, including peace and security, development and human rights,” he said.\n\n\"We are all working together to make this a better United Nations … Security Council reform process is a part and parcel of that,\" he said.",

    "content": "Eight cheetahs will be brought to India from Botswana in southern Africa in two phases, including four by May, officials have said.\n\nA release from the Madhya Pradesh government said this information was given by officials of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), who took part in a review meeting of the cheetah project here on Friday in the presence of Union Minister for Environment, Forests & Climate Change Bhupender Yadav and MP Chief Minister Mohan Yadav.\n\n”Efforts are underway to bring more cheetahs from South Africa, Botswana, and Kenya to India. Eight cheetahs will be brought to India in two phases. There is a plan to bring four cheetahs from Botswana to India by May. After this, four more cheetahs will be brought. At present, consent is being developed on an agreement between India and Kenya,” the release quoted NTCA officials as saying.\n\nIn the meeting, NTCA officials informed that more than Rs 112 crore has been spent on the cheetah project in the country so far, of which 67 per cent has gone into cheetah rehabilitation in Madhya Pradesh, the release stated.\n\n”Under Project Cheetah, cheetahs will now be relocated in a phased manner in Gandhi Sagar Sanctuary. The sanctuary is adjacent to the border of Rajasthan, so an in-principle agreement has been reached between Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan to establish an inter-state cheetah conservation area,” the release said.\n\nSpecial training is being given to ”cheetah mitras” in Kuno National Park and Gandhi Sagar Sanctuary to enhance their capacity, it added.\n\nIn the meeting, forest officials informed that there are 26 cheetahs at Kuno National Park, including 16 in the open forest and 10 in the rehabilitation centre (enclosures).\n\nOfficials said 24-hour tracking takes place using satellite collar IDs to monitor the cheetahs.\n\nFemale cheetahs Jwala, Asha, Gamini and Veera have given birth to cubs, they said, adding that the number of tourists in KNP has doubled in two years.\n\n”The state government has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking permission to start cheetah safari in Kuno. This permission is necessary to start safari in forest areas or eco-sensitive zones. The decision on this petition is yet to be made,” the release said.\n\nEight Namibian cheetahs, comprising five females and three males, were released in KNP on September 17, 2022, marking the first-ever intercontinental translocation of the big cats.\n\nIn February 2023, 12 more cheetahs were translocated from South Africa to KNP.\n\nKuno National Park has 26 cheetahs, including 14 India-born cubs.",

    "content": "India’s annual drug and pharmaceutical exports touched a record $30 billion in FY25, marking a 31 per cent surge in March. According to The Hindu, the exports stood at $30467.32 million, 9.39 per cent higher than the $27851.70 million clocked in FY24.\n\nPharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council Director General Raja Bhanu noted that pharma exports touched $30 billion for the first time, exceeding the FY25 target of $29.38 billion. The performance in the sector in the month of March stood out the most.\n\nWhile the shortage of generic prescription drugs in the US markets initially raised hopes, US President Donald Trump’s announcement to impose 26 per cent tariffs on Indian exports raised concerns. However, it is pertinent to note that the Trump tariffs, which are currently on hold for 90 days, did not apply to pharma exports.\n\nAccording to official data, pharma exports in March rose 31.21 per cent YoY. The next best performing month in the fiscal year was January, when the exports rose 21.47 per cent to $2590.88 million ($2132.92 million).\n\nThe US remains the prime market\n\nDespite Trump’s reciprocal tariff threats, the US continues to remain the largest market for Indian pharma exports, accounting for more than one-third of the trade. The exports to the US were 14.29 per cent at $8953.37 million. Meanwhile, the UK, Brazil, France and South Africa were other countries in the top five importing from India, but account for a combined less than 10.5 per cent of the exports.\n\nThere has been a contraction of 1.78 per cent in regards to exports to South Africa. During the 11 months of the fiscal year, the top 25 countries-markets where the exports declined were the United Arab Emirates (by 17.70 per cent); Turkey (16 per cent); Sri Lanka (14.60 per cent); The Netherlands (13.79 per cent), China (10.60 per cent) and Belgium (7.37 per cent). The decline in exports was 3.80 per cent to Mexico and 0.14 per cent to Thailand, official data showed.\n\nWhen it comes to regional data, NAFTA, Europe, and Africa were three major regions, together amounting to 76 per cent of Indian pharma exports. Among regions where the exports declined were Africa (by 1.74 per cent) and North East Asia (4.30 per cent).\n\nWith inputs from agencies.",

    "content": "On Friday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said that the country’s forex reserves increased by $1.5 billion to $677.8 billion for the week ended April 11.\n\nThis is the sixth consecutive week the Indian forex has seen a jump. The overall reserves jumped by $10.8 billion to $676.2 billion in the previous reporting week ended April 4.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the forex reserves reached an all-time high of $704.9 billion in September. Meanwhile, Gold reserves surged by $638 million to $79.997 billion, PTI reported.\n\nThe data released by the RBI showed that for the week ended April 11, foreign currency assets, a major component of reserves, rose by USD 892 million to USD 574.98 billion.\n\nThe foreign currency assets include the effect of appreciation or depreciation of non-US units like the euro, pound and yen held in the foreign exchange reserves.\n\nThe apex bank noted that the Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) were down USD 6 million at USD 18.356 billion. India’s reserve position with the IMF was also up by 43 million at USD 4.502 billion in the reporting week.\n\nThe declining trend for earlier weeks was due to revaluation and forex market interventions by the RBI to help reduce volatility in the rupee. The central bank said these declines have reversed in the last six weeks.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that an increase in the foreign exchange reserve also helps in bolstering the rupee vis-a-vis the US dollar and is good for the economy. Hence, the recent increase of foreign exchange reserve has made the rupee stronger.\n\nA strong forex reserve enables the RBI to intervene in the spot and forward currency markets by releasing more dollars to prevent the rupee from going into a free fall.\n\nThe figure reflects the strengthening of the external sector of the economy despite geopolitical tensions that have triggered economic uncertainty and instability in the world market.\n\nWith inputs from agencies.",

The Level 4 advisory covers the Khagrachari, Rangamati, and Bandarban districts.\n\nRegions rocked by communal tensions, violence\n\nThese regions have experienced serious security challenges in recent times. There have been multiple incidents of communal tensions, acts of terrorism, and politically motivated violence, such as the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and active shooter situations.\n\nIn addition, kidnappings have emerged as a growing concern. Some of these are related to personal disputes, while others appear to target individuals from religious minority communities, adding to the overall instability and risk in these areas.\n\nState Dept employees banned from visiting\n\nAccording to media reports, the US State Department employees are now banned from visiting these areas.\n\n“Do not travel to these areas for any reason,” the advisory stated. It added that prior approval from Bangladesh’s home ministry was mandatory before travel to these areas.\n\nThe advisory also urges US citizens to reconsider travel to these areas due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism.\n\nPolitical violence has increased in Bangladesh under the watch of the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.\n\nThe advisory comes amidst continuing political instability in the country following the ouster of former PM Sheikh Hasina in August last year.\n\n“US citizens are reminded to avoid all gatherings, even peaceful ones, since they could turn violent with little or no warning,” the advisory added.\n\nHindu leader killed in Bangladesh\n\nThe advisory also coincides with the brutal killing of a prominent Hindu leader in Dinajpur district in north Bangladesh.\n\nThe body of Bhabesh Chandra Roy, 58-year-old resident of Basudebpur village, was recovered on Thursday, according to Bangladeshi media. Roy was reportedly the vice-president of the Biral unit of the Bangladesh Puja Udjapan Parishad and a prominent leader of the Hindu community in the area.\n\nIndian government on Friday slammed Bangladesh for “systematic persecution of Hindu minorities” under the interim government. A statement issued by the foreign ministry called on the Bangladesh authorities to protect all minorities in the country.\n\n“We condemn this incident and once again remind the interim government to live up to its responsibility of protecting all minorities, including Hindus, without inventing excuses or making distinctions,” the statement said.",

The report was leaked on social media earlier this week.\n\n“We strongly condemn and repudiate any intention against the life of the president of the Republic, state authorities or public officials,” Ecuador’s Ministry of Government said in a statement early Saturday.\n\n“The state is on maximum alert,” it added.\n\nNoboa won the race in an April 13 runoff vote, but his main rival Luisa Gonzalez has accused him of committing “grotesque electoral fraud.”\n\nAlthough it has not named anyone in its report, the government has claimed that the assassination plot was hatched by “criminal structures in complicity with political sectors defeated at the polls.”\n\nEcuador’s electoral council and international observers have dismissed claims of fraud in the runoff vote, but Mexico and Colombia have yet to officially recognise Noboa’s win.\n\nWho is Daniel Noboa?\n\nNoboa, 37, used to be the owner of an event organising company when he was 18 and then joined his father’s Noboa Corp., where he held management positions in the shipping, logistics and commercial areas. He began his political career in 2021, when he won a seat in the National Assembly and chaired its Economic Development Commission.\n\nWhat are his plans to fight crime?\n\nNoboa defeated leftist lawyer Luisa González in the October 2023 runoff of a snap election triggered by the decision of then-President Guillermo Lasso to dissolve the National Assembly and shorten his own mandate as a result. Noboa defeated her again in Sunday’s runoff election.\n\nThe new term will allow Noboa, 37 and heir to a fortune built on the banana trade, to continue some of his no-holds-barred crimefighting strategies that part of the electorate finds appealing but which have tested the limits of laws and norms of governing.\n\nWith inputs from agencies",

    "content": "A court in Italy upheld the life sentences of Pakistani parents who were found guilty of killing their 18-year-old daughter because she refused an arranged marriage with her older cousin. The body of the girl named Saman Abbas was discovered buried in a farmhouse near her father’s office back in 2022.\n\nThe authorities found the body 18 months after she was first reported to be missing. After a thorough investigation, it was discovered that the young woman was murdered by her family, and since her neck was broken, the investigators believed that she died by strangulation.\n\nThe recent judgment in the case came on Friday following an appeal from Abbas’s parents to reduce the sentence. The authorities started suspecting that her parents were involved in the killing since they flew from Milan to Pakistan while the girl was still classified as missing.\n\nWhat the case is about\n\nIn the Friday ruling, Abbas’s mother, Nazia Shaheen, father Shabbir Abbas, uncle Danish Hasnain, and two cousins were sentenced for her killing. Hasnian was originally sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment but has since been re-sentenced to 22 years.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that Shabbir Abbas was extradited from Pakistan to Italy to serve his sentence, while Abbas’s mother was tried in absentia. She was eventually arrested near the Pakistani-occupied Kashmir border after she managed to escape prosecution for three years.\n\nMeanwhile, the young girl’s uncle and cousins fled to France and Spain but were also later arrested. Even in the recent hearing, the family continued to deny any wrongdoing. Shabbar Abbas went on to tell the court in the earlier hearings that “never in my life did I think of killing my daughter.”\n\nThe Abbas family moved to northern Italy from Pakistan when Saman was 14. The court filings stated that her family was deeply angered when she quickly adapted to “Western culture”. According to The Associated Press, she chose not to wear a head covering and posted photos of kissing her boyfriend in the streets.\n\nShe reportedly told her boyfriend that she was afraid for her life because she refused her parents’ demand to marry her older cousin back in Pakistan. According to the BBC, she spent several months living under the care of social services but eventually returned to her family home before her murder.\n\nWith inputs from the Associated Press.",

    "content": "There’s a new colour on the palette and no one knows about it yet. Scientists have claimed to have found a new hue that no one has seen before.\n\nA couple of researchers manipulated their eye cells by having laser pulses fired into their eyes which simulated the retina beyond its natural capacity and produced a colour unknown to the humandkind.\n\nWhile they cannot really describe the properties of the shade they saw, five people have said that it was sort of \" blue-green\", but they added that this description does not capture the full essence of their experience.\n\nRen Ng, an electrical engineer at the University of California, Berkeley, said, “We predicted from the beginning that it would look like an unprecedented colour signal but we didn’t know what the brain would do with it. It was jaw-dropping. It’s incredibly saturated.”\n\nThe researchers released an image of a turquoise square to provide a rough visual reference for the colour they’ve named “olo,” but emphasised that the true hue can only be perceived through precise laser stimulation of the retina.\n\n“There is no way to convey that colour in an article or on a monitor. The whole point is that this is not the colour we see, it’s just not. The colour we see is a version of it, but it absolutely pales by comparison with the experience of olo,” Austin Roorda, a vision scientist on the team told The Guardian.\n\nHow was the experiment conducted?\n\nHumans start perceiving the thousands of colours after light falls on the colour-sensitive cells on the retina called cones. Three types of cones, long (L), medium (M) and short (S), that are sensitive to colour based on the light’s wavelength.\n\nThe team at Berkeley aimed to overcome this challenge. They started by charting a small section of a person’s retina to locate the exact positions of their M cones. Using a laser, they then scanned the retina, and each time the laser aligned with an M cone—compensating for any eye movement—it delivered a brief, precise pulse of light to activate that individual cell before proceeding to the next one.\n\nThe colour lies outside the natural visual spectrum because it results from the near-exclusive stimulation of the M cones—something that natural light is incapable of producing. The name “olo” is derived from the binary code 010, representing that among the L, M, and S cones, only the M cones are activated.",

    "content": "Sitting in a crowd of mothers and children under the harsh sun, Najlaa Ahmed described the moment the Rapid Support Forces men poured into Darfur’s Zamzam displacement camp, looting and burning homes as shells rained down and drones flew overhead.\n\nShe lost track of most of her family as she fled. “I don’t know what’s become of them, my mother, father, siblings, my grandmother, I came here with strangers,” she said - one of six survivors who told Reuters of arson and executions in the raid.\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group - two years into its conflict with Sudan’s army - seized the massive camp in North Darfur a week ago in an attack that the United Nations says left at least 300 people dead and forced 400,000 to flee.\n\nThe RSF did not respond to a request for comment, but has denied accusations of atrocities and said the camp was being used as a base by forces loyal to the army. Humanitarian groups have denounced the raid as a targeted attack on civilians already facing famine.\n\nNajlaa Ahmed managed to get her children to safety in Tawila - a town 60 km (40 miles) from Zamzam controlled by a neutral rebel group - the third time, she said, she had been forced to flee the RSF in a matter of months.\n\nShe said she watched seven people die of hunger and thirst, and others succumb to their injuries on her latest journey.\n\nThe RSF has posted videos of its second-in-command, Abdelrahim Dagalo, promising to provide displaced people with food and shelter in the camp where famine was determined in August.\n\nBodies found\n\nMore than 280,000 people have sought refuge in Tawila according to the General Coordination for Displaced People and Refugees advocacy group, on top of the half a million that have arrived since the war broke out in April 2023.\n\nSpeaking from al-Fashir - the capital of North Darfur 15 km north of Zamzam which the RSF is trying to take from the army - one man who asked not to be named said he had found the bodies of 24 people killed in an attack on a religious school, some of them lined up.\n\n“They started entering people’s houses, looting&mldr; they killed some people &mldr; After this people fled, running in different directions. There were fires. They had soldiers burning buildings to create more terror.”\n\nAnother man, an elder in the camp, said the RSF had killed 14 people at close range in a mosque near his home.\n\n“People who are scared always go to the mosque to seek refuge, but they went into every mosque and shot them,” he said.\n\nReuters could not independently verify the reports.\n\nOne video verified by Reuters showed soldiers yelling at a group of older men and young men outside a mosque, interrogating them about a supposed military base.\n\nOther videos verified by Reuters showed RSF soldiers shooting an unarmed man as others lay on the ground. One showed armed men celebrating as they stood around a group of dead bodies.\n\nThe RSF has said such videos are fake.\n\nFight for Darfur\n\nThe capture of Zamzam comes as the RSF tries to consolidate its control of the Darfur region. Victory in al-Fashir would boost the RSF’s efforts to set up a parallel government to the one controlled by the army which has been on the upswing lately, retaking control of the capital Khartoum.\n\nThe war between the Sudanese army - which has also been accused of atrocities, charges it denies - and the RSF broke out in April 2023 over plans to integrate the two forces. The RSF’s roots lie in Darfur’s Janjaweed militias, whose attacks in the early 2000s led to the creation of Zamzam and other displacement camps across Darfur.\n\nResearchers from the Yale School of Public Health said in a report on Wednesday that more than 1.7 square km of the camp, including the main market, had been burned, and that fires had continued every day since Friday.\n\nThe researchers also saw checkpoints around the camp, and witnesses told Reuters that some people were being prevented from leaving.\n\nIn Tawila, Medical aid agency MSF received 154 injured people, the youngest of them seven months old, almost all with gunshot wounds, emergency field coordinator Marion Ramstein told Reuters.\n\nSupplies of food, water and shelter were already low before the new arrivals.\n\n“The lucky ones are the ones who find a tree to sit under,” Ramstein said.\n\nAhmed Mohamed, who arrived in Tawila this week, said he was robbed of all his possessions by soldiers on the road, and was now sleeping on the bare ground.\n\n“We are in need of everything a human being would need,” he said.",

    "content": "Pakistan’s foreign minister arrived in Afghanistan on Saturday to meet Taliban leaders after the country expelled over 85,000 Afghans, many of them children, in just over two weeks, news agency AFP reported.\n\nIslamabad is carrying out a tough campaign to remove more than 800,000 Afghans by the end of April.\n\nThese include people whose residence permits were cancelled, some of whom were born in Pakistan or have lived there for many years. Every day, Afghan families are rushing to the border, afraid of being raided, arrested, or separated from loved ones.\n\nPakistan’s foreign office said Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and a team of ministers are in Afghanistan for a one-day visit to meet top Taliban leaders, including Prime Minister Hasan Akhund.\n\nA video shared by the foreign office showed Dar being warmly welcomed in Kabul by Mohammad Naeem, the deputy foreign minister for financial and administrative affairs.\n\n“There will not be any sort of leniency or extension in the deadline,” Pakistan’s deputy interior minister Tallal Chaudhry told a news conference on Friday.\n\n“When you arrive without any documents, it only deepens the uncertainty of whether you’re involved in narcotics trafficking, supporting terrorism, or committing other crimes,” he added.\n\nPak minister calls Afghans terrorists and criminals\n\nPakistan’s interior minister has previously called Afghans “terrorists and criminals,” but experts say this is likely a political move to pressure the Taliban government over rising security issues, as well as to use them for their anti-India agenda and the use of terrorism as a foreign policy measure.\n\nMinister Naqvi said on Friday nearly 85,000 Afghans, most of them without proper documents, have returned to Afghanistan since early April.\n\nMostly children among leaving\n\nThe UN refugee agency said more than half of those leaving are children. They are entering a country where girls are banned from secondary schools and universities, and women face severe work restrictions.\n\nAfghanistan’s refugee ministry told AFP on Saturday that around 71,000 Afghans have returned through the two main border crossings between 1 and 18 April.",

    "content": "A Tunisian court handed jail terms of 13 to 66 years to opposition leaders, businessmen and lawyers on charges of conspiring, a case the opposition says is fabricated and a symbol of President Kais Saied’s authoritarian rule.\n\nRights groups say Saied has had full control over the judiciary since he dissolved parliament in 2021 and began ruling by decree. He dissolved the independent Supreme Judicial Council and sacked dozens of judges in 2022.\n\nTAP state news agency quoted a judicial official as saying the sentences ranged from 13 to 66 years. It did not provide further details about the sentences.\n\nThe trial started in March and has been postponed twice.\n\nForty people, including high-profile politicians, businessmen and journalists, were being prosecuted in the case. More than 20 have fled abroad since being charged.\n\nSome of the opposition defendants - including Ghazi Chaouachi, Issam Chebbi, Jawahar Ben Mbrak, Abdelhamid Jlassi, Ridha Belhaj and Khyam Turki - have been in custody since being detained in 2023.\n\n“In my entire life, I have never witnessed a trial like this. It’s a farce, the rulings are ready, and what is happening is scandalous and shameful,” said lawyer Ahmed Souab, who represents the defendants, on Friday before the ruling was handed down.\n\nAuthorities say the defendants, who also include former officials and former head of intelligence, Kamel Guizani, tried to destabilise the country and overthrow Saied.\n\nSome of the country’s most prominent opposition politicians - including Nejib Chebbi, the leader of the main National Salvation Front opposition coalition - are among the defendants in this case.\n\n“The authorities want to criminalise the opposition.” Chebbi said on Friday.\n\nSaied rejects accusations that he is a dictator. He said in 2023 the politicians were “traitors and terrorists” and that judges who would acquit them were their accomplices.\n\nThe opposition leaders involved the case accuse Saied of staging a coup in 2021 and say the case is fabricated to stifle the opposition and establish a one-man, repressive rule.\n\nThey say they were preparing an initiative aimed at uniting the fragmented opposition to face the democratic setback in the cradle of the Arab Spring uprisings.\n\nMost of the leaders of political parties in Tunisia are in prison, including Abir Moussi, leader of the Free Constitutional Party, and Rached Ghannouchi, the head of Ennahda - two of Saied’s most prominent opponents.",

    "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/trumps-tariffs-plan-could-destabilize-us-economy-economists-warn-13881208.html",
    "content": "Donald Trump’s simmering discontent with the US Federal Reserve boiled over this week, with the president threatening to take the unprecedented step of ousting the head of the fiercely independent central bank.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said he wants rate cuts now to help stimulate economic growth as he rolls out his tariff plans, and has threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell if he does not comply, putting the bank and the White House on a collision course that analysts warn could destabilize US financial markets.\n\n“If I want him out, he’ll be out of there real fast, believe me,” Trump said Thursday, referring to Powell, whose second four-year stint as Fed chair ends in May 2026.\n\nPowell has said he has no plans to step down early, adding this week that he considers the bank’s independence over monetary policy to be a “matter of law.”\n\n“Clearly, the fact that the Fed chairman feels that he has to address it means that they are serious,” KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk told AFP, referring to the White House.\n\nStephanie Roth, chief economist at Wolfe Research, said she thinks “they will come into conflict,” but does not think “that the Fed is going to succumb to the political pressure.”\n\nMost economists agree that the administration’s tariff plans – which include a 10 percent “baseline” rate on imports from most countries – will put upward pressure on prices and cool economic growth, at least in the short term.\n\nThat would keep inflation well away from the Fed’s long-term target of two percent, and likely prevent policymakers from cutting rates in the next few months.\n\n“They’re not going to react because Trump posted that they should be cutting,” Roth said in an interview, adding that doing so would be “a recipe for a disaster” for the US economy.\n\nFed independence ‘absolutely critical’\n\nMany legal scholars say the US president does not have the power to fire the Fed chair or any of his colleagues on the bank’s 19-person rate-setting committee for any reason but cause.\n\nThe Fed system, created more than a century ago, is also designed to insulate the US central bank from political interference.\n\n“Independence is absolutely critical for the Fed,” said Roth. “Countries that do not have independent central banks have currencies that are notably weaker and interest rates that are notably higher.”\n\nMoody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told AFP that “we’ve had strong evidence that impairing central bank independence is a really bad idea.”\n\n‘Can’t control the bond market’\n\nOne serious threat to the Fed’s independence comes from an ongoing case in which the Trump administration has indicated it will seek to challenge a 1935 Supreme Court decision denying the US president the right to fire the heads of independent government agencies.\n\nThe case could have serious ramifications for the Fed, given its status as an independent agency whose leadership believes they cannot currently be fired by the president for any reason but cause.\n\nBut even if the Trump administration succeeds in court, it may soon run into the ultimate guardrail of Fed independence: The bond markets.\n\nDuring the recent market turbulence unleashed by Trump’s tariff plans, US government bond yields surged and the dollar fell, signaling that investors may not see the United States as the safe haven investment it once was.\n\nFaced with the sharp rise in US Treasury yields, the Trump administration paused its plans for higher tariffs against dozens of countries, a move that helped calm the financial markets.\n\nIf investors believed the Fed’s independence to tackle inflation was compromised, that would likely push up the yields on long-dated government bonds on the assumption that long-term inflation would be higher, and put pressure on the administration.\n\n“You can’t control the bond market. And that’s the moral of the story,” said Swonk.\n\n“And that’s why you want an independent Fed.”",

    "content": "The US Supreme Court on Saturday paused the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members, citing an 18th-century law. In a brief judgment, the top court ordered the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelan nationals held in Texas’s Bluebonnet Detention Centre “until further order of this court.”\n\nThe court was hearing an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union, arguing that deportations under the Trump 2.0 administration seem to be moving in the direction of removal under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.\n\n“The government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this court,” the court order said.\n\nThe ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe Supreme Court had earlier noted that deportations are only possible if the ones who are supposed to be removed from the US have the chance to argue their case in court and were given “a reasonable time” to contest their pending removals.\n\n“We are deeply relieved that the Court has temporarily blocked the removals. These individuals were in imminent danger of spending the rest of their lives in a brutal Salvadoran prison without ever having had any due process,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt said in an email to the Associated Press.\n\nWhat is the Alien Enemies Act?\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act of 1798 is a US federal law that grants the president the authority to detain or deport non-citizens from countries at war with the United States. Enacted during the presidency of John Adams, it was designed to protect national security during times of war or “predatory incursion” by foreign powers.\n\nThe act has only been invoked three previous times in US history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps.\n\nThe Trump administration contended it gave them the power to swiftly remove immigrants they identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.\n\nWith inputs from agencies",

    "content": "Iran and the United States will hold a new round of nuclear talks in Rome on Saturday to resolve their decades-long standoff over Tehran’s atomic aims, under the shadow of President Donald Trump’s threat to unleash military action if diplomacy fails.\n\nIran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff will negotiate indirectly through mediators from Oman, a week after a first round in Muscat that both sides described as constructive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso read: Round 1 in Oman, 2 in Rome: Can Trump fix the nuclear deal with Iran he broke in 2018? Here’s what expert says\n\nAraqchi has arrived in Rome to attend the second round of the talks, according to a post on his Telegram account. He said in Moscow on Friday that Iran believes reaching an agreement on its nuclear programme with the United States is possible as long as Washington is realistic.\n\nTehran has however sought to tamp down expectations of a quick deal, after some Iranian officials speculated that sanctions could be lifted soon. Iran’s utmost authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said this week he was “neither overly optimistic nor pessimistic”.\n\nFor his part, Trump told reporters on Friday: “I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon. They can’t have a nuclear weapon. I want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.”\n\nTrump, who ditched a 2015 nuclear pact between Iran and six powers during his first term in 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on Tehran, has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran since returning to the White House in January.\n\nWashington wants Iran to halt production of highly enriched uranium, which it believes is aimed at building an atomic bomb.\n\nTehran, which has always said its nuclear programme is peaceful, says it is willing to negotiate some curbs in return for the lifting of sanctions, but wants watertight guarantees that Washington will not renege again as Trump did in 2018.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince 2019, Iran has breached and far surpassed the 2015 deal’s limits on its uranium enrichment, producing stocks far above what the West says is necessary for a civilian energy programme.\n\nA senior Iranian official, who described Iran’s negotiating position on condition of anonymity, listed Iran’s red lines as never agreeing to dismantle its uranium enriching centrifuges, halt enrichment altogether or reduce its enriched uranium stockpile below levels agreed in the 2015 deal. Iran also rejects negotiating about defence capabilities such as missiles.\n\nWhile both Tehran and Washington have said they are set on pursuing diplomacy, there is still a wide gap between them on the dispute that has rumbled on for more than two decades.\n\nWitkoff and Araqchi interacted briefly at the end of the first round last week, but officials from the two countries have not held direct negotiations since 2015, and Iran said the Rome talks would also be held indirectly through the Omani mediators.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussia, a party to Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement, has offered “to assist, mediate, and play any role” that will be beneficial to Iran and the United States.",

    "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/trump-administration-slashes-funding-for-native-american-boarding-school-research-projects-by-1-6-million-13881177.html",
    "content": "At least $1.6 million in federal funds for projects meant to capture and digitize stories of the systemic abuse of generations of Indigenous children in boarding schools at the hands of the U.S. government have been slashed due to federal funding cuts under President Donald Trump’s administration.\n\nThe cuts are just a fraction of the grants canceled by the National Endowment for the Humanities in recent weeks as part of the Trump administration’s deep cost-cutting effort across the federal government. But coming on the heels of a major federal boarding school investigation by the previous administration and an apology by then-President Joe Biden, they illustrate a seismic shift.\n\n“If we’re looking to ‘Make America Great Again,’ then I think it should start with the truth about the true American history,” said Deborah Parker, CEO of the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.\n\nThe coalition lost more than $282,000 as a result of the cuts, halting its work to digitize more than 100,000 pages of boarding school records for its database. Parker, a citizen of the Tulalip Tribes in Washington state, said Native Americans nationwide depend on the site to find loved ones who were taken or sent to these boarding schools.\n\nSearching that database last year, Roberta “Birdie” Sam, a member of Tlingit & Haida, was able to confirm that her grandmother had been at a boarding school in Alaska. She also discovered that around a dozen cousins, aunts and uncles had also been at a boarding school in Oregon, including one who died there. She said the knowledge has helped her with healing.\n\n“I understand why our relationship has been the way it has been. And that’s been a great relief for myself,” she said. “I’ve spent a lot of years very disconnected from my family, wondering what happened. And now I know — some of it anyways.”\n\nAn April 2 letter to the healing coalition that was signed by Michael McDonald, acting chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, says the “grant no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities.”\n\nThe Associated Press left messages by phone and email for the National Endowment for the Humanities. White House officials and the Office of Management and Budget also did not respond Friday to an email requesting comment.\n\nIndigenous children were sent to boarding schools\n\nFor 150 years the U.S. removed Indigenous children from their homes and sent them away to the schools, where they were stripped of their cultures, histories and religions, and beaten for speaking their native languages.\n\nAt least 973 Native American children died at government-funded boarding schools, according to an Interior Department investigation launched by former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. Both the report and independent researchers say the actual number was much higher.\n\nThe forced assimilation policy officially ended with the enactment of the Indian Child Welfare Act in 1978. But the government never fully investigated the boarding school system until the Biden administration.\n\nIn October, Biden apologized for the government’s creation of the schools and the policies that supported them.\n\nHaaland, a Laguna Pueblo citizen who’s running for governor in New Mexico, described the recent cuts as the latest step in the Trump administration’s “pattern of hiding the full story of our country.” But she said they can’t erase the extensive work already done.\n\n“They cannot undo the healing communities felt as they told their stories at our events to hear from survivors and descendants,” she said in a statement. “They cannot undo the investigation that brings this dark chapter of our history to light. They cannot undo the relief Native people felt when President Biden apologized on behalf of the United States.”\n\nBoarding school research programs are feeling the strain\n\nAmong the grants terminated earlier this month was $30,000 for a project between the Koahnic Broadcast Corporation and Alaska Native Heritage Center to record and broadcast oral histories of elders in Alaska. Koahnic received an identical letter from McDonald.\n\nBenjamin Jacuk, the Alaska Native Heritage Center’s director of Indigenous research, said the news came around the same time they lost about $100,000 through a Institute of Museum and Library Services grant for curating a boarding school exhibit.\n\n“This is a story that for all of us, we weren’t able to really hear because it was so painful or for multitudes of reasons,” said Jacuk, a citizen of Kenaitze Indian Tribe. “And so it’s really important right now to be able to record these stories that our elders at this point are really opening up to being able to tell.”\n\nFormer Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs Bryan Newland described the cuts as frustrating, especially given the size of the grants.\n\n“It’s not even a drop in the ocean when it comes to the federal budget,” said Newland, a citizen of the Bay Mills Indian Community (Ojibwe). “And so it’s hard to argue that this is something that’s really promoting government efficiency or saving taxpayer funds.”\n\nIn April 2024, the National Endowment for the Humanities announced that it was awarding $411,000 to more than a dozen tribal nations and organizations working to illustrate the impact of these boarding schools. More than half of those awards have since been terminated.\n\nThe grant cuts were documented by the non-profit organization National Humanities Alliance.\n\nJohn Campbell, a member of Tlingit and the Tulalip Tribes, said the coalition’s database helped him better understand his parents, who were both boarding school survivors and “passed on that tradition of being traumatized.”\n\nWhen he was growing up, his mother used to put soap in his mouth when he said a bad word. He said he learned through the site that she experienced that punishment beginning when she was 6-years-old in a boarding school in Washington state when she would speak her language.\n\n“She didn’t talk about it that much,” he said. “She didn’t want to talk about it either. It was too traumatic.”",

    "content": "The death toll in the US strike on Yemen’s Ras Isa fuel port rose to 80 as rescue workers struggled to take hold of the situation. The toll was confirmed by the Houthi-run health ministry, which included civilians and rescue workers. The Friday incident has now become the deadliest attack since Washington launched its campaign against the Iran-backed militant group.\n\nThe rebels’ Al-Masirah TV, citing local officials, said the toll from the strike had “risen to 80 dead and 150 wounded”. Ras Isa fuel port, where the attack took place, was touted as a major economic site in Yemen. Analysts believe that the attack sends a message to Iran as the country already receives mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump over its nuclear programme.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nSoon after coming back to the White House, Trump threatened to “annihilate” Yemen’s Houthis after the group conducted several attacks on the Red Sea as a protest against Israel’s military operation in Gaza. Earlier this year, the Trump administration’s first strike on the Yemeni group drew backlash after its plans were shared on a Signal chat group, which later got leaked to the public.\n\nHouthis vow to fight back\n\nSoon after the attack, Houthis released a statement in which the group vowed to fight back. In the immediate aftermath, the Iran-backed group said that it had targeted two US aircraft carriers and a military site near Israel’s main airport.\n\n“The American military buildup and continued aggression against our country will only lead to more counterattacks and attack operations, clashes and confrontations,” the Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree told a rebel-organised protest in the capital, Sana’a. According to The Guardian, the US strikes hit several areas but were mostly concentrated around the port facility. Hence, the dead included truck drivers and emergency responders.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the Ras Isa terminal has a storage capacity of 3 million barrels and was the first port built for oil exports from Yemen, about 40 years ago. The US has vowed to keep attacking Yemen’s Houthis, in its biggest military operation in the Middle East since Trump took office in January, unless the Houthis cease attacks on Red Sea shipping.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran called the Friday attack “barbaric” while Hamas denounced the strikes as “blatant aggression”. Hours after the US strike, Israel’s military said it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. However, the experts are now questioning the practicality of the US war aims in Yemen.\n\nWith inputs from agencies.",

Our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved family during this difficult time,” the official said.\n\nHamilton Police said they received reports of a shooting around 7:30 pm local time near Upper James and South Bend Road in Hamilton. When officers arrived, they found Harsimrat Randhawa with a gunshot wound to the chest. She was taken to hospital but did not survive.\n\nPolice said video footage showed that someone in a black car fired at people in a white sedan. Both cars drove away soon after the shooting.\n\nSome of the bullets also hit a nearby house, entering through the back window while people were inside watching TV.",

    "content": "It’s Easter Saturday, and one more beloved chocolate is off the shelves in Britain: Toblerone. The triangular-shaped chocolate treats have been discontinued in the UK as people have a taste for other delights now.\n\nA spokesperson for Toblerone’s maker, Mondelēz, said the decision to cease production in Britain was “difficult” and was taken because of “changing tastes.”\n\n“While we understand that this may be disappointing for some consumers, we continue to invest in Toblerone,” the spokesperson added without mentioning whether the product would be discontinued outside the UK.\n\nToblerone’s exit from the UK confectionery market follows Mars Delight, Cadbury Dream and Rowntree’s Texan, which have been discontinued over the years.\n\nWhy was Toblerone taken off the shelves?\n\nDark chocolate Toblerone is fading from the spotlight as a new favourite takes centre stage: “Dubai chocolate.” This indulgent bar, filled with pistachio cream and crunchy toasted knafeh—a classic Middle Eastern dessert made with shredded filo—has grabbed the attention of chocolate lovers.\n\nLindor has jumped on the trend with its luxurious version, retailing at £10 per bar. For a more budget-friendly option, Lidl has introduced its take on the nutty treat for £4.99.\n\nThe news of Toblerone’s farewell also comes at a time when cocoa prices have reached a record high. According to figures by the Office for National Statistics, chocolate prices have gone up by 13.6 per cent till March this year.\n\nBrits say goodbye to many other choco delights\n\nToblerone is not the first chocolate to be taken away from connoisseurs.\n\nLast year, Nestlé announced it was removing Breakaway bars from its production lines, citing declining sales as the reason behind discontinuing the once-popular lunchbox favorite.\n\nMilky Way Crispy Rolls were taken off shelves in 2022, much to fans’ disappointment. However, earlier this year, Mars brought the beloved treat back—along with new twists on the original, introducing Bounty and Twix-inspired versions of the chocolate-wafer bar.",

    "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/us-airstrike-on-houthi-held-yemen-port-kills-over-70-in-major-escalation-13881163.html",
    "content": "A US airstrike on an important oil port held by Yemen’s Houthi rebels killed more than 70 people and wounded many others, the Iranian-backed rebel group said Friday, marking a major escalation in the military campaign President Donald Trump launched against the faction last month.\n\nThe overnight strike on the Ras Isa port sent massive fireballs billowing skyward and turned tanker trucks into burning wrecks. It was the first American attack on a Houthi-controlled oil facility in the new US bombing campaign. It also came just before the resumption of negotiations in Rome between the US and Iran over Tehran’s rapidly advancing nuclear program, which Washington has linked to its attacks in Yemen.\n\nThe US is targeting the Houthis because of the group’s attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, a crucial global trade route, and on Israel. The Houthis are the last militant group in Iran’s self-described “Axis of Resistance” that is capable of regularly attacking Israel.\n\nThe port is a major hub for incoming fuel shipments that power areas of Yemen held by the Houthis, and analysts say the airstrike could seriously affect daily life there.\n\nThe Houthis, who said the attack killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, aired graphic footage of the aftermath on their al-Masirah satellite news channel, showing corpses strewn about the port and smashed tanker trucks. They denounced the strike as a “completely unjustified aggression.”\n\n“It targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades,” the group said in a statement.\n\nUS Central Command declined to answer any questions about possible civilian casualties but referred to a statement in which it said “this strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen.”\n\n“US forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years,” it said in its statement.\n\nA US official said the attack sent a message to those supplying fuel to the Houthis despite sanctions. The official spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public.\n\nHours after the US strike, the Houthis launched a missile toward Israel that was intercepted, the Israeli military said. Sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and elsewhere. Meanwhile, the Houthis said they shot down another American MQ-9 Predator drone, which the US official acknowledged.\n\nThe port’s strategic significance\n\nThe Ras Isa port is a collection of oil tanks and equipment that sits in Yemen’s Hodeida governorate along the Red Sea. It is just off Kamaran Island, which has been targeted by intense US airstrikes in recent days.\n\nBefore the Houthis took control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, in 2014 and sent the government into exile, oil from the country’s energy-rich Marib governorate moved through Ras Isa for export. But since the Houthis don’t control that region, the port now serves as an import hub for gasoline, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas that help power those parts of Yemen the Houthis control.\n\nA deadly escalation of Trump’s Yemen campaign\n\nThe new US operation against the Houthis under Trump appears more extensive than attacks on the group were under President Joe Biden, an AP review found. The new campaign started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting “Israeli” ships again over Israel blocking aid from entering the Gaza Strip.\n\nFrom November 2023 until this January, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.\n\nAssessing the toll of the month-old US airstrike campaign has been difficult because the military hasn’t released information about the attacks, including what was targeted and how many people were killed. The Houthis, meanwhile, strictly control access to attacked areas and don’t publish complete information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites.\n\nThe Ras Isa port airstrike is the deadliest known attack yet in the month-old campaign. The actual cost in lives is hard to assess, said Luca Nevola, the senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a think tank.\n\n“Since they are targeting civilian areas, there’s a lot more victims. But it’s also difficult to assess how many because the Houthis are releasing these umbrella statements that cover all the victims &mldr; or tend to stress only the civilian victims,” Nevola said.\n\nFurther complicating the situation is the US strikes hitting military targets, said Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert at the Basha Report risk advisory firm. He pointed to an American attack that Trump highlighted online with black-and-white strike footage, which might have killed about 70 fighters.\n\n“Although the Houthis claimed it was a tribal gathering, they neither released any footage nor named a single casualty, strongly suggesting the victims were not civilians but affiliated fighters,” al-Basha said. “However, the overnight strike on the Ras Isa Fuel Port marks the first mass-casualty incident the Houthis have openly acknowledged and publicized.”\n\nThe AP analyzed satellite images of the port provided by Planet Labs PBC that showed destroyed oil tanks and vehicles, and what appeared to be oil leaking into the Red Sea.\n\nWim Zwijnenburg, an analyst with the Dutch peace organization PAX, said it appeared at least three fuel storage tanks had been destroyed and that oil had leaked from mooring pipelines.\n\nThe US airstrikes continued overnight into early Saturday, with the Houthis reporting them in Yemen’s al-Jawf, Sadaa and Sanaa governorates.\n\nThe US accuses a Chinese company of aiding Houthi attacks\n\nA US State Department spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, accused a Chinese commercial satellite image provider, Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd., of “directly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on US interests.”\n\nDuring a briefing with reporters, Bruce did not elaborate in detail. But she acknowledged a report by The Financial Times that quoted anonymous American officials saying the company linked to the People’s Liberation Army has provided images allowing the rebels to target US warships and commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea corridor.\n\nBruce said “Beijing’s support” of the satellite company &mldr; “contradicts their claims of being peace supporters.”\n\nResponding to a question about the allegation, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Friday: “I am not familiar with the situation you mentioned.” However, he insisted China is seen as urging countries “to make more efforts conducive to regional peace and stability.”\n\n“Since the escalations in the Red Sea situation, China has been playing a positive role in de-escalating the situation,” Lin said. “Who is promoting talks for peace and deescalating the tensions, and who is imposing sanctions and pressure?”\n\nThe company didn’t respond to request for comment. The US Treasury sanctioned it in 2023 for allegedly providing satellite images to the Russian mercenary force the Wagner Group as it fought in Ukraine.\n\nIt remains unclear whether Chang Guang is linked to the Chinese government. The US government in the past has used images taken by American commercial satellite companies to share with allies, like Ukraine, to avoid releasing its own top-secret pictures.",

The news story was about the senator meeting Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had been deported to a high-security prison in El Salvador.\n\nIn a post on X, the official White House account shared a screenshot of the New York Times article titled “Senator Meets With Wrongly Deported Maryland Man in El Salvador.” But in the version posted by the White House, the words “wrongly” and “Maryland man” were crossed out in red and replaced with “MS-13 illegal alien,” along with the added phrase “who’s never coming back.”\n\nAt the centre of this political controversy is 29-year-old Kilmar Abrego Garcia—an undocumented migrant the White House says is a known member of the violent MS-13 gang. He had been living with his family in Maryland before being deported in March as part of a wider crackdown on migrants with alleged gang ties.\n\nSupreme Court calls deportation a mistake\n\nHowever, the US Supreme Court later ruled that Garcia’s deportation was a mistake, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor saying there was no legal basis for his arrest or removal.

    "content": "A federal judge on Friday stopped the Trump administration from enforcing a policy that would ban the use of the “X” gender marker on passports and restrict people from changing their gender marker.\n\nThe policy, part of an executive order signed in January, defines people strictly as male or female and does not recognise gender transition. This view aligns with conservative beliefs but goes against medical experts and previous policies under former President Joe Biden.\n\nUS District Judge Julia Kobick, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, sided with the American Civil Liberties Union’s motion for a preliminary injunction, which stays the action while the lawsuit plays out.\n\n“The Executive Order and the Passport Policy on their face classify passport applicants on the basis of sex and thus must be reviewed under intermediate judicial scrutiny,” Kobick wrote. “That standard requires the government to demonstrate that its actions are substantially related to an important governmental interest. The government has failed to meet this standard.” The ACLU, which sued the Trump administration on behalf of five transgender Americans and two nonbinary plaintiffs, said the new policy would effectively mean transgender, nonbinary and intersex Americans could not get an accurate passport.\n\n“We all have a right to accurate identity documents, and this policy invites harassment, discrimination, and violence against transgender Americans who can no longer obtain or renew a passport that matches who they are,” ACLU lawyer Sruti Swaminathan said.\n\nIn response to the lawsuit, the Trump administration argued the passport policy change “does not violate the equal protection guarantees of the Constitution.” They also contended that the president has broad discretion in setting passport policy and that plaintiffs would not be harmed by the policy, since they are still free to travel abroad.",

The second round is set for Saturday in Rome and will be held through Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baghaei, said.\n\n“Given the contradictory positions we have heard from various U.S. officials over the past few days, we expect the U.S. side to first provide an explanation in this regard and to remove the serious ambiguities that have arisen regarding its intentions and seriousness,” Baghaei told state media without elaborating.\n\nIran told the United States in talks last week it was ready to accept some limits on its uranium enrichment but needed water-tight guarantees that President Donald Trump would not again ditch a nuclear pact, a senior Iranian official said on Friday.\n\nTrump has threatened to attack Iran if it does not reach a deal with the U.S. over its nuclear programme, which Iran says is peaceful but the West says is aimed at building an atomic bomb.\n\n“I’m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon.

    "link": "https://www.firstpost.com/world/india-now-has-a-waqf-law-how-islamic-countries-regulate-such-properties-13881153.html",
    "content": "Even as the new federal law to govern waqfs has become controversial in India, neither the practice nor laws governing it are unique to India.\n\nWaqfs are an established Islamic practice and provisions to govern them exist in several countries. Even as there is criticism for the new Indian law, the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, several provisions of the Indian law match those of many Muslim-majority countries.\n\nCurrently, the Supreme Court is hearing a clutch of petitions that have challenged the constitutionality of the law. Until the next hearing of the case in May, certain provisions of the law have been put on hold.\n\nHere is how waqfs are managed in some Muslim majority countries.\n\nWhat is a ‘waqf’?\n\nIn simple terms, a ‘waqf’ refers to a charitable endowment in Islam in the name of God. Such endowments are made in perpetuity.\n\nSuch endowments are usually made for specific purposes, such as for the construction of the mosque or the education of the community’s children.\n\nBy custom (and by law in some cases), waqfs cannot be sold and cannot be used for purposes other than the specific purpose(s) they were created for.\n\nIn most countries with Muslim majorities or substantial Muslim population, there are laws and statutory bodies governing the dedication, management, and other aspect of waqfs. In India, the current law has replaced a previous law made in 1995 and amended in 2013. The 1995 law had replaced the previous law made in 1954 that had replaced the previous British-era law made in 1923. The first legal provisions were introduced in 1913.\n\nHow are waqfs managed in Islamic countries?\n\nIn several Islamic countries, laws exist to govern waqfs, such as in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Turkey, Oman, Iran, Kuwait, UAE, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Bahrain.\n\nThe cases of Saudi Arabia and Jordan are important as Saudi Arabia is the custodian of the two most sacred Islamic sites in Mecca and Medina. It is also the birthplace of Islam. Jordan is the custodian of the third most sacred Islamic site, the Al-Aqsa mosque of Jerusalem. The royal family of Jordan also traces ancestry to Prophet Mohammed, the founder of Islam.\n\nAs per a factsheet published by the Indian government, there is near-overlap between the new waqf law in India and the law in Saudi Arabia (see graphic below). The only difference being that Saudi Arabia does not allow the inclusion of non-Muslims into the management of waqfs like the Indian law — understandably as Saudi Arabia is an Islamic country and not a secular country like India.\n\nSimilar to India’s new law, Jordan has a system where courts have jurisdiction over waqf-related matters. However, as Jordan is an Islamic country, the courts that oversee waqf-related matters are special religious courts and not regular courts.\n\nOn the contrary, under the previous Indian waqf law, the court’s authority on waqf matters was very limited and waqf tribunals’ decisions could only be challenged with a revision petition and not appeals in higher courts. In an appeal, the case is thoroughly reexamined whereas revision petitions only allow for the reexamination of procedural and jurisdictional issues, not the facts of the case.\n\nOne major difference in the management of waqfs and several other countries is the inclusion of non-Muslims in the management under the new Indian law. Except for some Islamic countries, such as Turkey, where non-Muslims may be allowed some roles in waqfs though the provisions appear to be vague regarding it, most of the countries do not have such provisions.\n\nAt least in some capacities, non-Muslims are also part of waqfs’ affairs in Iran and Oman.\n\nThe factsheet says that there are no provisions for representation of Muslims from socially disadvantaged or backward classes in waqf bodies in Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Turkey, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Iran, and Maldives. The new Indian waqf law allows representation from one member from Shia, Sunni, Bohra, Aghakhani, and other backward classes among Muslims.",

    "content": "An explosive report found that over half a million US weapons obtained by the Taliban in Afghanistan have been “lost, sold or smuggled” to several militant groups. The revelation, made in a BBC report, claims that the United Nations believes some of these weapons have fallen into the hands of al-Qaeda affiliates.\n\nA former Afghan official, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC that the Taliban took control of around one million weapons and pieces of military equipment after it regained control of Kabul in 2021. The official said that many Afghan soldiers surrendered or fled, abandoning their weapons and vehicles when the Taliban took over the country. The source noted that several military equipment were simply left behind by US forces.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nAs per the report, the cache included American-made firearms, such as M4 and M16 rifles, as well as other older weapons in Afghan possession that were accumulated from decades of conflict. Sources told the BBC that during the closed-door meeting in Doha last year, the Taliban admitted to the UN Security Council’s Sanctions Committee that at least half of this equipment is now “unaccounted” for.\n\nUN raises a new alarm\n\nIn a report published in February, the United Nations raised concerns that these weapons may have reached the hands of al-Qaeda affiliates. The international body argued groups such as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, and Yemen’s Ansarullah movement were accessing Taliban-captured weapons or buying them on the black market.\n\nWhen the BBC asked Hamdullah Fitrat, deputy spokesperson for the Taliban government, about the latest revelation, the Taliban official said that it took the “protection and storage of weapons very seriously.” “All light and heavy weapons are securely stored. We strongly reject claims of smuggling or loss,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, in a 2023 UN report, the body said that the Taliban allowed local commanders to retain 20 per cent of the seized US weapons. These commanders are affiliated with the Taliban but often have a degree of autonomy in their regions. The UN also noted that “gifting of weapons is widely practised between local commanders and fighters to consolidate power. The black market remains a rich source of weaponry for the Taliban”.\n\nTrump’s tryst with weapons\n\nIn the past, Trump has repeatedly said that he will reclaim weapons from Afghanistan. The Republican firebrand often mentioned how $85bn of advanced weaponry was left in the country once the Taliban took over.\n\n“Afghanistan is one of the biggest sellers of military equipment in the world, you know why? They’re selling the equipment that we left,” Trump said during his first cabinet meeting of the new administration. “I want to look into this. If we need to pay them, that’s fine, but we want our military equipment back,” he added.\n\nIn response to Trump’s remarks, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban’s chief spokesperson, told Afghan state TV: “We seized these weapons from the previous administration and will use them to defend the country and counter any threats.”\n\nEver since the takeover, the Taliban has been frequently seen parading American weapons, including at Bagram Airfield, which served as the main US-NATO base. Hence, it’ll be interesting to see how Trump would react to the latest revelation.",

    "content": "The United States will roughly halve the number of troops it has deployed in Syria to less than 1,000 in the coming months, the Pentagon said Friday.\n\nWashington has had troops in Syria for years as part of international efforts against the Islamic State (IS) group, which rose out of the chaos of the country’s civil war to seize swaths of territory there and in neighboring Iraq over a decade ago.\n\nThe brutal jihadists have since suffered major defeats in both countries, but still remain a threat.\n\n“Today the secretary of defense directed the consolidation of US forces in Syria&mldr; to select locations,” Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement, without specifying the sites where this would take place.\n\n“This deliberate and conditions-based process will bring the US footprint in Syria down to less than 1,000 US forces in the coming months,” he said.\n\n“As this consolidation takes place&mldr; US Central Command will remain poised to continue strikes against the remnants of (IS) in Syria,” Parnell added, referring to the military command responsible for the region.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has long been skeptical of Washington’s presence in Syria, ordering the withdrawal of troops during his first term but ultimately leaving American forces in the country.\n\nAs Islamist-led rebels pressed forward with a lightning offensive last December that ultimately overthrew Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Trump said Washington should “NOT GET INVOLVED!”\n\n“Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,” Trump, then the president-elect, wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nYears of war against IS\n\nThe 2014 onslaught by IS prompted a US-led air campaign in support of local ground forces – the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Iraqi government units.\n\nWashington also deployed thousands of American personnel to advise and assist local forces, with US troops in some cases directly fighting the jihadists.\n\nAfter years of bloody warfare, Iraq’s prime minister announced a final victory over IS in December 2017, while the SDF proclaimed the defeat of the group’s “caliphate” in March 2019 after seizing its final bastion in Syria.\n\nBut the jihadists still have some fighters in the countryside of both countries, and US forces have long carried out periodic strikes and raids to help prevent the group’s resurgence.\n\nWashington stepped up military action against IS in Syria in the wake of Assad’s overthrow, though it has more recently shifted its focus to strikes targeting Yemen’s Huthi rebels, who have been attacking international shipping since late 2023.\n\nUS forces in Iraq and Syria were repeatedly targeted by pro-Iran militants following the outbreak of the Gaza war in October 2023, but responded with heavy strikes on Tehran-linked targets, and the attacks largely subsided.\n\nWashington for years said it had some 900 military personnel in Syria as part of international efforts against IS, but the Pentagon announced in December 2024 that the number of US troops in the country had doubled to around 2,000 earlier in the year.\n\nWhile the United States is reducing its forces in Syria, Iraq has also sought an end to the US-led coalition’s presence there, where Washington has said it has some 2,500 troops.\n\nThe United States and Iraq have announced that the coalition would end its decade-long military mission in federal Iraq by the end of 2025, and by September 2026 in the autonomous Kurdistan region.",

Several of them are charred,” Lokumu told AFP.\n\nJoseph Lokondo, a local civil society leader who said he helped bury the bodies, put the “provisional death toll at 145: some burned, others drowned”.\n\nLokumu said the blaze was caused by a fuel explosion ignited by an onboard cooking fire.\n\n“A woman lit the embers for cooking. The fuel, which was not far away, exploded, killing many children and women”, she said.\n\nMissing loved ones\n\nThe total number of passengers on board the doomed vessel was not known but Lokumu said it was in the “hundreds”.\n\nSome survivors were rescued and admitted to hospital, Lokondo said.\n\nBut on Friday, he added, “several families were still without news of their loved ones”.\n\nA vast Central African nation, the Democratic Republic of Congo suffers from a lack of practicable roads.\n\nAs a result travel often occurs on lakes, the Congo River and its tributaries, where shipwrecks are frequent and the death tolls often heavy.\n\nA chronic absence of passenger lists often complicates search operations.\n\nIn October 2023, at least 47 people died after a boat navigating the Congo sank in Equateur.\n\nMore than 20 people died in October last year when a boat capsized on Lake Kivu in eastern DRC, according to local authorities.\n\nAnother shipwreck on Lake Kivu claimed around 100 lives in 2019.",

    "content": "U.S. Vice President JD Vance met with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Friday for a second day of talks on tariffs and then attended Good Friday services at the Vatican amid speculation of a possible pope greeting this weekend.\n\n“I’ve been missing you,” Meloni jokingly told Vance as he entered the courtyard of Chigi Palace, the premier’s office.\n\nThey had seen each other just the previous day in the Oval Office, where Trump lavished praise on the Italian leader for her crackdown on migration but didn’t yield on tariff plans that have increased tensions with the European Union and stoked fears of recession.\n\nThe White House and Meloni’s office on Friday issued a joint statement that said Trump would visit Italy “in the very near future.”\n\n“There is also consideration to hold, on such occasion, a meeting between U.S. and Europe,” the statement said.\n\nVance having Vatican meetings after tangle with pope\n\nVance, a Catholic convert, later attended Good Friday services with his wife and three children in St. Peter’s Basilica and was scheduled to meet Saturday with the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin.\n\nNo meeting with Pope Francis was officially announced and the pontiff didn’t attend the solemn, two-hour Good Friday service or the nighttime Way of the Cross procession at Rome’s Colosseum. The 88-year-old pope has cut back his work schedule as he recovers from a near-fatal case of double pneumonia, and his participation in the weekend’s Easter services is uncertain.\n\nFrancis, however, recently met with King Charles III and officials haven’t ruled out a possible audience with Vance, who has criticized Francis on social media in the past, though more recently offered prayers for his recovery.\n\nFrancis and Vance have tangled sharply over migration and the Trump administration’s plans to deport migrants en masse. Francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative U.S. Catholic Church.\n\nJust days before he was hospitalized in February, Francis blasted the Trump administration’s deportation plans, warning that they would deprive migrants of their inherent dignity. In a letter to U.S. bishops, Francis also appeared to respond to Vance directly for having claimed that Catholic doctrine justified such policies.\n\nVance had defended the administration’s America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin as “ordo amoris.” He has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care — to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere.\n\nIn his Feb. 10 letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance’s understanding of the concept.\n\n“Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,” he wrote. “The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the ‘Good Samaritan,’ that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.”\n\nVance has acknowledged Francis’ criticism but has said he would continue to defend his views.\n\n“I’m grateful every day for this job, but particularly today where my official duties have brought me to Rome on Good Friday,” Vance posted on X. “I wish all Christians all over the world, but particularly those back home in the US, a blessed Good Friday.”\n\nGood Friday commemorates Christ’s crucifixion and is marked by the Vatican with a Latin-filled service in St. Peter’s and a nighttime, torchlit procession at the Colosseum.\n\nMeloni as a bridge between the US and EU\n\nMeloni has positioned herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and Europe and was the lone EU leader to attend his inauguration. As the head of a far-right party, she is ideologically aligned with Trump on issues such as curbing migration and promoting traditional values. But Italy and the United States have diverged over Meloni’s strong support for Ukraine, while Trump’s tariff threat has put pressure on Meloni to defend the EU’s trade interests on behalf of the bloc.\n\nA bond market panic led Trump to partially pull back on his tariffs by pausing his 20% import taxes on the EU for 90 days and charge a baseline 10% instead. But Trump said Thursday he was in no rush to reach any trade deals.\n\nVance on Friday reaffirmed the U.S.-Italy friendship and told Meloni that he would brief her on some “interesting” developments in Russia-Ukraine negotiations. “Big trade negotiations” would continue, he said.\n\nLike Trump, Vance seemed dazzled by Meloni’s Italian language even though he didn’t understand what she was saying.\n\n“Of course, she could have called me a jerk and I wouldn’t know, but it would be in the most beautiful language imaginable, so I wouldn’t even get offended,” he said at the start of their talks.",

    "content": "Political wisdom of history would tell that the intersection of personal experience and political ideology often shapes public policy stances. In India and the entire Buddhist world, the story goes that Ashoka, The Great, the Maurya emperor ruling from southern Bihar over an empire spread up to Afghanistan, was so overwhelmed with the killings in the Kaligna war that he renounced violence, not just war as an instrument of politics. But US President Donald Trump is different.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nFew modern political figures embody paradoxes as starkly as Trump, his critics would say. Despite surviving two assassination attempts in 2024 and witnessing recurrent mass shootings — including the April 17 incident at Florida State University that left two dead and six injured — Trump didn’t deter from his advocacy for expansive gun rights.\n\nThe tension between Trump’s lived encounters with firearm violence and his unwavering support for the Second Amendment, contextualised within broader debates over gun control, political rhetoric, and public safety, remains uncomfortably calm in the US.\n\nThe man, not the gun\n\nA 20-year-old Florida State University student, Phoenix Ikner, opened fire in the Student Union Building, killing two individuals and injuring six others, including himself on Thursday. This happened against a backdrop of heightened political tension over gun legislation, with Trump recently reaffirming his alliance with the National Rifle Association (NRA) and urging gun owners to mobilise for the 2024 election.\n\nIkner, described as a white supremacist with far-right leanings, legally obtained firearms through his mother, a Leon County Sheriff’s Office deputy. The incident reignited debates about access to firearms, particularly among individuals with extremist ideologies, and the efficacy of background checks—a system Trump has historically criticised as overly restrictive.\n\nThe university cancelled classes and events for two days, while law enforcement agencies statewide increased patrols. Survivors and victims’ families joined calls for legislative action, but Trump’s response emphasised mental health rather than gun control, echoing his long-standing argument that “guns don’t kill people; people kill people”. This framing aligns with his post-Parkland shooting rhetoric, where he initially advocated for stronger background checks before backtracking under pressure from the NRA.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nA policy shift that never happened\n\nTrump survived two attempts on his life during the 2024 election campaign at Butler and West Palm Beach. Trump’s first brush with assassination occurred on July 13, 2024, during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when Thomas Matthew Crooks fired shots that injured Trump’s ear and killed a bystander.\n\nThe second attempt followed on September 15, 2024, at Trump’s West Palm Beach golf club, where Ryan Wesley Routh allegedly planned an attack but was neutralised by Secret Service agents before firing. These events thrust Trump into the rare position of being both a victim of gun violence and a champion of firearm deregulation.\n\nRather than moderating his stance, Trump leveraged the attempts to bolster his pro-gun narrative. In a speech days after the West Palm Beach incident, he argued that armed citizens could deter such attacks, saying, “If one patriot in that crowd had been carrying, Crooks would’ve been stopped before he pulled the trigger.”\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThis rhetoric mirrors his 2016 claim that an armed civilian could have mitigated the Pulse nightclub shooting — a claim debunked by the presence of an armed security guard who engaged the shooter.\n\nThe thought that Trump would at least tone down his love for guns and temper with his absolute advocacy of gun rights turned out to be mere wish of those fighting a different kind of war against the powerful gun lobby.\n\nTrump actually exploited his survival for his political revival\n\nTrump’s survival reinforced his self-image as a “fighter” for constitutional rights. At the National Rifle Association’s (NRA’s) 2024 annual meeting, he framed his endurance as proof of resilience against “radical leftists who want to disarm America”.\n\nHis campaign launched the “Gun Owners for Trump” coalition, targeting voters who perceive firearm ownership as a bulwark against government overreach. This strategy capitalised on a key demographic: conservative gun owners who used to vote disproportionately in Republican primaries but historically exhibit lower general election turnout. Things changed by November 2024. Democrat voters sat out and Republicans overwhelmed polling centres, recent data analysis suggests.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nA long-lasting affair that is unlikely to end\n\nTrump’s relationship with gun legislation has been marked by volatility. After the 2018 Parkland shooting, which killed 17, he initially pledged to strengthen background checks and raise the minimum age for firearm purchases.\n\nHowever, faced with NRA opposition, he abandoned these proposals, later dismissing them as “unworkable” without Republican support. This reversal underscored the NRA’s enduring influence over his administration, despite the organisation’s legal troubles and declining membership.\n\nBy 2024, Trump’s platform explicitly prioritised dismantling gun control measures. He vowed to revoke the Biden administration’s rule closing the “gun show loophole,” which allows unlicensed dealers to sell firearms without background checks.\n\nAt the same time, he accused President Biden of seeking to “confiscate weapons” and erode Second Amendment rights — a claim contradicted by Biden’s focus on regulating assault weapons and expanding red-flag laws.\n\nTrump’s 2024 rhetoric also reintroduced the disputed statistic that “98% of mass shootings occur in gun-free zones,” a figure FactCheck.org traced to a flawed 2014 study that conflated non-public spaces with legally designated zones.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nBy reviving this talking point, Trump sought to justify proposals to arm teachers and expand concealed carry permits, despite evidence that increased firearm availability correlates with higher rates of accidental shootings and escalations in violence.\n\nTrump versus Biden over guns through elections, administrations\n\nGun control was one of the key policy differences between Trump and his successor-predecessor Joe Biden. The Biden administration established the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, chaired by Vice President Kamala Harris, to coordinate federal responses to firearm-related deaths.\n\nKey initiatives included universal background checks, a federal red-flag law, and a ban on assault weapons — a policy gaining traction even among moderate Democrats. Harris emphasised that firearm-related injuries have overtaken car accidents as the leading cause of death for American children, a statistic she attributed to lax gun laws. Trump was against the idea of controlling gun rights.\n\nTrump put forward his counterarguments and mobilised a vocal, not necessarily larger, base. His rebuttals hinged on cultural and constitutional appeals. He framed gun ownership as a patriotic duty and warned that Democratic policies would leave citizens vulnerable to crime and tyranny.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThis view of Trump draws support from incidents such as the one that happened in Belize, where a man attempted to hijack a flight with a knife, and was shot down by a passenger. To many across the world, it would come as a surprise that a passenger was travelling with a gun on his person. Fortunately for Trump supporters, he shot the hijacker and saved many lives. But this appears more as a security check failure than a comment on the merits of the US’s gun policy.\n\nThis message resonates with rural and suburban voters who view firearms as tools for self-defence and symbols of individual liberty. Trump’s alliance with the NRA, which endorsed him in 2024 despite its diminished political capital, reinforces this narrative.\n\nHowever, critics note the inconsistency in Trump’s logic: while he credits armed bystanders with preventing violence, his own survival relied on Secret Service intervention rather than civilian action. Moreover, his dismissal of gun control measures after mass shootings — including the latest Florida incident — ignores research linking firearm accessibility to higher homicide rates.\n\nGuns in trigger-happy hands with radicalised minds\n\nThe Florida State shooter, Phoenix Ikner, exemplifies the risks of coupling extremist ideologies with easy access to firearms. Many on Trump’s side of polity are guided by white supremacist beliefs.\n\nAdvocacy for Trump’s agenda also highlights how political rhetoric can radicalise individuals, particularly in online echo chambers. Trump’s reluctance to condemn far-right groups, combined with his opposition to measures restricting firearm sales to extremists, creates a policy vacuum that critics argue enables such violence.\n\nTrump’s repeated use of debunked statistics — such as the “gun-free zones” claim — has muddied public understanding of gun violence. By conflating correlation with causation, he shifts focus from legislative solutions to speculative scenarios involving armed civilians. This approach not only polarises debates but also diverts attention from evidence-based strategies, such as safe storage laws and mandatory waiting periods.\n\nTrump and guns: It’s a paradox of survival and ideology\n\nDonald Trump’s unwavering defence of gun rights, despite surviving assassination attempts and presiding over a nation plagued by mass shootings, underscores a broader political belief system. Trump’s ideological commitment to the Second Amendment comes as a non-negotiable pillar of American freedom.\n\nHis rhetoric, which frames firearm ownership as a remedy to violence rather than a contributor, appeals to a base that views gun control as government overreach. This political campaign goes on despite this stance increasingly clashing with public safety concerns, particularly as high-profile shootings expose flaws in current firearm regulations.\n\nBut then the 2024 election has solidified Trump’s position as the standard-bearer for gun rights advocates. It has also intensified scrutiny of his policy contradictions. The United States grapples with high firearm mortality rates — about 47,000 deaths in 2023, declining through Biden years, at the rate of 13.7 per 100,000 people, according to Pew Research.\n\nWith Trump staying strong in his second presidency, the tension of political philosophy between individual liberties and collective security remains unresolved as it is a tension embodied by a leader who has both endured and played down the consequences of gun violence.",

They must first be admitted to a school that is approved by the U.S. government, and then generally interview at a consulate abroad to obtain their entry visa.\n\nOnce in the country, international students must remain in good standing with their academic program, and are generally limited in their ability to work off-campus. After they graduate, they can work in the U.S. for 12 months, and up to 36 months for STEM majors, before they must seek a longer-term employment visa.\n\nInternational students' status is maintained in a system called SEVIS, or the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. Generally, students' status is terminated in SEVIS when they fail to maintain standing with their program, or when they graduate or transition to a different visa. Terminations, until now, have largely been initiated by schools doing routine data updates.\n\nIn recent weeks, colleges have discovered their students' status terminated by the government, a significant shift from past practices. The terminations often have minimal written justification or notice from the government, leaving students with little information on why they are now out of status.\n\nStudents have begun to file lawsuits across the country, with a number of temporary restraining orders granted in lawsuits from New Hampshire, Montana and Wisconsin.\n\nInternational students are also caught in the crosshairs of a standoff between Harvard and the Trump administration, which has made various threats against the Ivy League institution after learning of its defiance against demands related to activism on campus, antisemitism and diversity.

The former Odisha Chief Minister, who has helmed the regional party since its formation in 1997, was the sole nominee for the post.\n\nExpressing gratitude to the people of Odisha, Patnaik said, “From 2000 to 2024, the people have blessed us with the opportunity to serve. This is more than a political mandate—it’s a reflection of their trust in our governance.”\n\nHe reaffirmed his commitment to Odisha’s development, pride, and dignity, emphasising that the BJD’s mission transcends electoral victories.\n\n“Whether in power or not, our dedication to public service remains. Our workers are our real strength, and our disciplined, grassroots cadre makes us resilient,” he said.\n\nPatnaik also pointed to the party’s recent electoral setback, attributing the loss of a few key seats in 2024 to what he termed “false narratives” propagated during the campaign. He acknowledged the need to bolster the party’s communication, particularly on social media, to counter misinformation and maintain direct engagement with the public.\n\n“The BJD will always stand united for Odisha’s interests. Our journey is not just about forming governments—it is about preserving the self-respect and aspirations of our people,” he stated.\n\nPatnaik’s re-election triggered mixed reactions across the political spectrum. While leaders and well-wishers extended congratulations, Odisha BJP president Manmohan Samal offered a more critical tone alongside his best wishes.\n\n“I congratulate Naveen Babu and hope he is ready for the challenges ahead—both political and administrative,” Samal told reporters shortly after the announcement.\n\nHe went on to criticise the previous BJD government, reiterating the BJP’s accusations of mismanagement and lack of transparency. “Our concerns were never just political rhetoric—they were grounded in reality. The misuse of central funds during Patnaik’s regime remains unaddressed. To date, he hasn’t provided a single convincing explanation,” Samal alleged.\n\nSamal also cited recent electoral trends as evidence of a shifting political landscape in Odisha. “People are beginning to see through the façade. The BJP made significant gains in both vote share and public trust. Voters are demanding accountability and a break from the status quo,” he said.\n\nDespite the sharp critique, Samal maintained that the BJP respects democratic processes and values the role of a strong opposition. “Democracy thrives on accountability. The people of Odisha deserve a government that listens, acts, and evolves,” he concluded.",

    "link": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/sports/cricket/the-enigma-of-number-18-virat-kohlis-cosmic-connection-1873851",
    "content": "Virat Kohli, a name synonymous with cricketing excellence, has always carried a deep connection with the number 18. This number, emblazoned on his jersey, is more than just a digit—it’s a symbol of personal loss, resilience, and destiny. However, recent events have added an eerie twist to this narrative, further intertwining his cricketing journey with the mystique of this number.\n\nOn April 18, 2025, during an IPL match between Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Punjab Kings, Kohli was dismissed for just 1 run. While this might seem like an ordinary low score, the date and circumstances make it extraordinary. Exactly 17 years earlier, on April 18, 2008, in the inaugural IPL match, Kohli—then a budding cricketer—was also dismissed for 1 run while playing for the same team, RCB. The symmetry of these events, separated by nearly two decades, is nothing short of astonishing.\n\nThe Legacy of Number 18\n\nKohli’s association with the number 18 began during his under-19 days, but it gained profound significance after the untimely demise of his father on December 18, 2006. At just 18 years old, Kohli shouldered the weight of personal tragedy and emerged stronger, channeling his grief into his cricketing ambitions. The number became a tribute to his father, a constant reminder of the strength he derived from his loss.\n\nInterestingly, Kohli’s international debut also occurred on the 18th of August, 2008, further cementing the number’s cosmic role in his life. Over the years, fans and analysts have noted how pivotal moments in his career often align with this number, making it a recurring motif in his journey.\n\nCosmic Coincidences in Cricket\n\nThe 2025 and 2008 dismissals are not the only instances where cricket has thrown up such uncanny parallels. Here are a few other notable coincidences in the sport:\n\n1. Sachin Tendulkar and the Number 99 : Tendulkar, the \"God of Cricket,\" was dismissed on 99 runs, a record three times in ODIs, a number that haunted him as he approached his 100th international century.\n\n2. MS Dhoni’s Final Six : Dhoni’s iconic six to win the 2011 World Cup mirrored his first-ever six in international cricket, both struck with the same helicopter shot.\n\nA Symbol of Resilience\n\nFor Kohli, the number 18 is more than a jersey—it’s an emotional anchor, a testament to his resilience and determination. Whether it’s a coincidence or a cosmic alignment, these moments add layers to his already illustrious career, making him a figure of intrigue both on and off the field.\n\nAs cricket fans, we can only marvel at how the sport continues to weave such fascinating narratives, reminding us that beyond the runs and wickets, it’s the stories that truly captivate us.",

    "content": "With the arrest of 13 people, Punjab Police on Saturday claimed to have busted two major ISI-backed Khalistani terror modules that were being run from abroad and seized two rocket-propelled grenades, two hand grenades, IEDs and RDX along with other munitions.The first terror module was operated by France-based Satnam Singh alias Satta and the second by Greece-based Jaswinder alias Mannu Agwan, Director General of Police Gaurav Yadav said.\n\nThese modules, which were backed by Pakistan's spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), were being operated by a proscribed terrorist outfit Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) from abroad, Yadav said. This is a major blow to transnational terror networks targeting peace and stability in Punjab, said Yadav in a post on X.\n\nSharing details, the DGP said the police seized two rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) including a launcher, two IEDs (2.5 kg each), two hand grenades with detonators, two kg RDX with remote control, five pistols (Beretta and Glock), six magazines, 44 live cartridges, one wireless set and three vehicles.\n\nThe arrested have been identified as Jatinder alias Honey, Jagjit alias Jagga, both residents of Kapurthala, Harpreet and Jagroop, both from Hoshiarpur, said the DGP, adding their terror module was operated Satta. He said a case has been registered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the Explosives Act in Amritsar. About the second terror module, Yadav said nine operatives have been arrested. The case has been registered under the UAPA and the Explosives Act in Batala.",

    "title": "Book Review | Two Marginalised Communist Heroes",
    "link": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/booksart/book-review-two-marginalised-communist-heroes-1873849",
    "content": "At the outset, it makes sense to write a mainstream biography of two important figures of the Indian Communist movement, especially given the relatively spare mainstream material on both the quixotic revolutionary known as Virendranath ‘Chatto’ Chattopadhyay, and the much more recognised M.N. Roy: father of the Communist Parties in both Mexico and India, and scrappy participant to the very end in political struggles across the ideological and geographical span of the 20th century.\n\nIt is in the twinning of the two that the questions begin to emerge. Kavitha Rao’s newest book, Spies, Lies and Allies takes us back and forth across the early to mid-20th century, tracing the life of the two firebrands in parallel. The organising logic seems to be as follows: These were both remarkable men in their own right, whose written work and political organising had large consonances even as they rarely ever overlapped across their careers. And there is, indeed, much here of interest in thinking about their own revolutionary projects, these admirable failures, to those of us engaged in our own recursive attempts to steer this world towards happier times.\n\nYet remarkable and compelling as their stories may be, there is an unsteadiness to this juxtaposition, an awkwardness of movement in how we jump cut across these men and their respective trajectories, which clash only once, however consequently, around 1920 in the Soviet Union. There, as in life, Roy emerges the more successful of the two.\n\nThere have been other books written on Chatto and Roy before: Rao acknowledges her great debt to Nirode K. Barooah and Sibnarayan Ray’s respective biographies of the two. Hers is by comparison a more modest undertaking, to make accessible the story of two figures unsung to various degrees in the broader, well-peopled pantheon of Indian nationalists and revolutionaries.\n\nTo compress both lives into two hundred is a task Rao pulls off only fleetingly. The pacing is brisk, moving nimbly across the early decades of their lives with admirable assurance. Yet the book and its author seem to bear the rigour of its production perhaps too openly. The prose often buckles under the weight of its own archival material: Too many endless quotes, and often heavy on names and bureaucratic detail. Over time, Rao’s transparent prose veers much too close to textbook-like tedium.\n\nIt is a good thing the material speaks for itself. Even amidst the gruelling internecine sniping of communists around the world, counterarguments to counterarguments and committee meetings of varying import, there is much to savour in the scrappy, resilient fire of both these men, which leaves in their wake figures ranging from Bagha Jatin in Bengal to Savarkar in London and Lenin in Soviet Russia. Their steam powers this book to the finish line; a painful, often frustrating but frequently thrilling micro-history of the Indian left.\n\nSpies, Lies and Allies: The Extraordinary Lives of Chatto and Roy\n\nBy Kavitha Rao\n\nWestland\n\npp. 272; Rs 499",

    "link": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/booksart/book-review-ideal-idyllic-bhutan-still-young-and-restless-1873847",
    "content": "Bhutan is a tiny Himalayan country wedged between two powerful countries, India and China. Its 7,35,000 people and 14,824 square miles of territory (about the size of the Indian state of Kerala) is hemmed in by neighbours with populations well over a billion each. The fact that this tiny, and till recently very backward, nation has managed to both maintain its independence and prosper is testimony to its unique culture and polity.\n\nThe country’s first Opposition leader and current Prime Minister, Tshering Tobgay’s book is an insider’s view of the personalities and processes that have guided Bhutan from its inception as a kingdom in 1907 to a multiparty democracy today.\n\nFrom the author’s account of the political processes in his country, it is obvious that the country’s polity is deeply rooted in tradition and its monarchy that continues to be a paternalistic guiding force. The country continues to seek inspiration in its Vajrayana Buddhist past, particularly the trio of Buddha, Guru Padmasambhava and Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, the founding father of Bhutan who posited that if a government fails to cultivate happiness for its people, it has no reason to exist.\n\nThis belief continues to guide Bhutan’s leaders. The world would perhaps be a better place if more of its rulers and politicians emulated that ideal.\n\nAt any rate, what makes Bhutan unique is its concept of Gross National Happiness (GNH) which shifts focus away from economic growth and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a measure of a nation’s development and progress. Bhutan’s 4th king believed it necessary to remove the centrality of material progress and replace it with a more holistic yardstick that would place the wellbeing of the people at the centre of all policy making and governance.\n\nThis, according to the author, obviates the potential harm of unfettered development. One major consequence of this approach is the remarkable preservation of Bhutan’s fragile Himalayan ecology. Bhutan today is a global exemplar in sustainability.\n\nYet everything is not hunky dory, the author admits. Particularly worrying is the outward migration of its youth to the Middle East, America, Canada and Australia.\n\n“Our population is already very small and while the prospect of losing our youth is already deeply concerning, more migration could potentially lead to a hollowing out of Bhutan and pose a significant threat to our future,” the author warns.\n\nThis leads us to the overwhelming question: Why, despite being pronounced the world’s last Shangri-la and having an unexceptionable concept such as gross national happiness at the core of governance, do Bhutan’s youth wish to migrate? Is it the human condition that compels the young to forever seek fresh pastures or is there some restless longing in all people that draws them towards the light of frenetic civilisations? At the end of the day what Bhutan perhaps proves is that people everywhere wish to be part of the larger mainstream and cannot be confined to the margins no matter how idyllic that might seem to be.\n\nEnlightened Leadership: Inside Bhutan’s Inspiring Transition from Monarchy to Democracy\n\nTshering Tobgay\n\nPenguin\n\npp. 274; Rs 599",

    "content": "During a scorching Seoul summer, Kyungha, a writer and historian, subsists on water and rice and white kimchi, ordered online and delivered to her apartment. Troubled by migraines and digestive ailments, she refuses to leave her apartment for treatment. Instead, she works on her will, deciding the disposition of her property but unable to name an executor. She works on her suicide note, her letter of leavetaking, her inability to perfect it warding death away.\n\nA message from a close friend and professional partner, a photographer, Inseon, wakes Kyungha from this existence. Inseon is in hospital recovering from a carpentry accident in which she’s lost her fingers. She asks Kyungha to go to her house on the island of Jeju right away to save Inseon’s pet budgie, and Kyungha, for whom the friendship is precious, does just that.\n\nBut winter has set in on the island: it is covered in snow, and a storm is gaining strength. Kyungha finds the bird motionless, and is unsure of whether it lives or not. But then, conditions are such that she has to stay, which she does. The bird, a budgie, begins to show signs of life.\n\nIt’s worthwhile explaining a little of the history of the island. When Korea was divided, some years after World War II, its inhabitants had strong leftist leanings and protested against being included in the South. Government paramilitaries under the oversight of the US Army putting down the protests killed many thousands — estimates range between 14,000 and 30,000 — including women and children, even infants.\n\nIn Han Kang’s writing, the snow in Jeju blankets the killings, which, however, still lurk below the surface, available to anyone persistent enough to dig. Some of the surreal quality to Han Kang’s writing comes from a snowstorm that distorts the borders of reality and hallucination, permitting apparitions to drift in and out of the narrative that actually dissolves the distance between the hidden tragedies and atrocities of the past and the present.\n\nKyungha has written about massacres: her last book was about one in the city of G. But this time it’s up close and personal. Inseon’s father survived because the prison he was in was overcrowded.\n\nInseon — or an apparition of her — turns up on Jeju Island in the midst of a terrible snowstorm, and as she and Kyungha explore Inseon’s memories and her mother’s notes, details of the horrors of 1948 begin to emerge. The fact of Inseon’s father’s survival comes up, for instance, as Inseon and Kyungha begin to explore Inseon’s mother’s notes. The unreason behind the killing echoes through the narrative: Inseon’s uncle, imprisoned at about the same time as her father, is shot on a beach along with a group of people from another village, and children are shot in the name of ‘extermination’. But there is also a fragile redemption in the form of a single candle flame leading to life, an icon of the friendship between Kyungha and Inseon.\n\nEasily the best book I’ve read in the last couple of years.\n\nWe Do Not Part\n\nHan Kang\n\nPenguin\n\npp. 384; Rs 999",

    "content": "We are proud to be leading this narrative and resonating with women who want to feel alive and celebrated through our jewelry, says Amanpreet Ahluwalia, business head, Zoya in an exclusive interview to Deccan Chronicle.\n\nWhat inspired the creation of Zoya, and what sets it apart from other jewellery brands in India?\n\nZoya is all about the woman who has a very discerning taste in life. She’s travelled the world, has great exposure, and is accomplished in her personal and professional spaces. We identified a niche in the Indian market where women are proud of their roots but want to own the best. Our research showed that there’s a certain age where the eye for finer things becomes obvious, and you can’t settle for anything less. We saw an opportunity to create jewelry that’s not just wearable but also meaningful and personalized. That’s where Zoya came in—a brand that’s about wearable art, warm luxury, and creating experiences. We are not just a jewelry brand; we are about building meaningful jewelry that plays a role in a woman’s life. The name Zoya means ‘alive,’ and our color palette is inspired by pastels. We draw from India’s rich craft and stories, but with a modern twist.\n\nCan you walk us through Zoya’s approach to sustainability?\n\nAt Zoya, sustainability is deeply ingrained in our ethos. If you visit our Pantnagar factory you will know—it’s like a mini forest with extensive plantation, and we run on fully renewable sources of energy. Water conservation is also a priority, with a focus on reconsuming water. We care about our artisans’ well-being, ensuring a balance between their professional and personal lives. We also prioritize responsible sourcing, avoiding conflict diamonds and focusing on credible suppliers. For us, sustainability has three key angles: environmental consciousness, artisan welfare, and responsible sourcing. We are committed to making a positive impact through our practices.\n\nCan you tell us about Zoya’s expansion plans in South India, particularly in cities like Hyderabad and Bangalore?\n\nAfter establishing ourselves in Bombay and Delhi for almost 8-10 years, we expanded to other cities. We wanted to open in Hyderabad first, but it took us about a year and a half to find the right place. Bangalore became our first store outside of Bombay and Delhi. Soon after, we opened in Hyderabad, and later in Chennai. The South market has been a significant growth area for us, and we are continuing to expand there, with a new boutique opening in Bangalore soon.\n\nWhat makes Hyderabad a unique market for Zoya, and what trends have you observed in the city’s jewelry market?\n\nHyderabad is a city that invests in lifestyle, with a flair for the finer things in life. The city has a deep love for jewelry, particularly precious stones like emeralds, rubies, and diamonds. We have noticed two distinct segments in Hyderabad—the traditional segment that loves fine luxury jewelry with precious stones, and the younger generation that’s embracing modern, wearable jewelry. Our transactions in Hyderabad are among the highest in the country, reflecting the city’s spending power and eye for detail. We involve Hyderabad in our design process, meeting clients and testing trends to ensure our collections resonate with the city’s discerning audience.\n\nWhat are Zoya’s plans for expansion in terms of the number of stores to be added this year and in the coming years?\n\nTypically, we add 2-3 boutiques every year, but last year was an exception where we added 4. Our biggest challenge in expansion is finding the right locations and real estate. We are quite particular about creating an immersive experience for our customers, and that takes time. Malls aren’t always the best fit for us, and we are selective about where we open our boutiques. For the foreseeable future, we are looking at adding 2-3 boutiques every year.\n\nWhat are some of the key trends you have observed in the jewelry market, and how is Zoya positioned to capitalize on these trends?\n\nWe are growing at a 40-45% CAGR and expect to maintain that growth rate this year. As for market trends, we have noticed a significant shift towards wearable jewelry that’s versatile and practical. Our customers want pieces that can be dressed up or down, paired with various outfits, and worn frequently. We have been at the forefront of this trend, and it’s exciting to see it gain momentum. Wearable jewelry that’s beautiful, dainty, and effortless is a big space, and we feel proud to have led this change.\n\nWhat sets Zoya apart from other luxury jewelry brands, and how do you position yourself in the market?\n\nFor us, the key differentiator is celebrating the India story and creating products that are truly global. Our meaningful jewelry, inspired by India’s rich heritage, sets us apart. From the Flower of Life to Stepwells of India, our designs tell stories that resonate with women. We are proud to showcase India’s soul and pride globally, and it’s reflected in our customers’ preference for Zoya over international brands. Indian women are making a conscious choice to support a brand that offers quality, craftsmanship, and meaningful storytelling. We are growing rapidly, and it’s a testament to the brand’s strength and the Indian woman’s intelligence and discernment.\n\nWhat’s next for Zoya, and how do you plan to continue innovating and expanding your brand?\n\nOur big plan is to introduce high jewelry pieces through our Studio Z development center in Bombay. We are creating rare, limited-edition pieces that our clients can experience and own. Expansion is also on the cards, particularly in the South, where we are looking at opening more stores in cities like Bangalore and Chennai. We are continuously innovating on products and patented settings, and we are always hungry for India stories that we can convert into meaningful pieces. Our latest collection, Reborn, reflects our commitment to redefining the way jewelry is experienced and bought in India. We are proud to be leading this narrative and resonating with women who want to feel alive and celebrated through our jewelry.\n\nCan you share some anecdotes about your customers in Hyderabad and how Zoya creates meaningful experiences for them?\n\nAnecdote 1: The Gentleman’s Story\n\nI recall a gentleman who came in for a milestone anniversary gift. He fell in love with our Rooted collection, inspired by a strong woman who stands tall like a tree in the rainforest. The story resonated so much with him that he ended up buying 15 times his original budget. That’s the power of jewelry that tells a story that resonates with you.\n\nAnecdote 2: The Bespoke Piece\n\nWe had a client who wanted a bespoke piece inspired by the tulips in Kashmir. She wanted to capture the moment when the light falls on the blooming tulip, making her feel alive. Our designer brought her vision to life, and when she saw the piece, her emotion was priceless. That’s what bespoke jewelry is all about – creating something meaningful and unique.\n\nAnecdote 3: The Late-Night Purchase\n\nWe had a client who wanted to buy jewelry at 10 pm, and we kept the store open for him. We made sure he had a great experience, and it built loyalty for our brand. That’s the kind of personalized service we strive for.\n\nAnecdote 4: The Surprise Gift\n\nWe curated a surprise evening for a client who wanted to gift his wife jewelry. We planned the evening, sent personalized invites, curated a menu, and played her favorite music. It was a memorable experience for both of them, and that’s what sets us apart.",

    "content": "Kalaburagi: With Assembly elections still three years away, the BJP has already hit the campaign trail in earnest, signalling an early and aggressive bid to reclaim power in Karnataka.\n\nOn Thursday, BJP State President and MLA B.Y. Vijayendra led the Janakrosha Yatra in Kalaburagi—the home turf of AICC president Mallikarjun Kharge and state minister Priyank Kharge.\n\nIn what was a show of strength deep inside Congress territory, Vijayendra rallied party workers, declaring that the next three years would be a “relentless phase of political struggle” for the BJP.\n\n“As State President, I accept the challenge of winning every Assembly seat in this district,” he declared. “Kalaburagi will no longer be a safe zone for the Congress.”\n\nHe reassured local workers that they would not be alone in the fight. “No BJP worker in Kalaburagi should feel let down—your Vijayendra is with you.”\n\n“This is not the time to wait for elections,” he told a massive crowd. “Treat every day from now as part of our fight. Be ready for a long battle.”\n\nHe asked district presidents and office-bearers to prepare for an aggressive campaign and urged the cadre to respond boldly to any insult or injustice meted out to BJP or Hindu activists.\n\n“Wherever our workers are targeted, you must unite and protect them,” he said. “Congress can try to demoralize us, but our karyakartas didn’t enter politics for compromise. We won’t back down.”\n\nTaking direct aim at the Congress, he said, “Let me see if there’s anyone left in Congress who can do real politics. We are not afraid.”\n\nVijayendra made it clear that BJP is eyeing a sweep in Kalaburagi, a Congress bastion.\n\nDespite the scorching heat, a large turnout at the rally underscored the party’s organizational push.\n\n“No matter who we’re up against, BJP workers have the strength to stand tall. I urge our leaders—stay united,” he said, adding, “I am indebted to all of you for making this event a success.”\n\nThe Janakrosha Yatra, he said, aimed to expose the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government’s failures, especially its unfulfilled poll guarantees.\n\n“Siddaramaiah promised a model government. But after coming to power, he conveniently forgot all his guarantees,” he alleged. “In fact, just before the polls, money was transferred to voters—this isn’t governance, it’s bribery.”\n\nVijayendra accused the Chief Minister of treating citizens like beggars. “On one hand, he announces free bus rides for women. On the other hand, he cancels thousands of rural routes. Now, students from farming families can’t even reach schools and colleges,” he said.\n\nHe also took a swipe at the government for failing to fund the state-run KSRTC, saying the state owes Rs 6,500 crore to the corporation. He added that electricity tariffs had been quietly hiked by 36 paise per unit, further burdening ordinary citizens.",

    "content": "Tirupati, April 19: TTD Chairman B.R. Naidu on Saturday said he would request Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu to initiate an Anti-Corruption Bureau investigation into all alleged irregularities at the Lord Venkateswara temple here over the past five years.\n\nHis remarks come in the wake of allegations by YSRCP leaders that over 100 cows died at the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams' Goshala (cow shelter) in the past three months.\n\n\"As soon as the Chief Minister returns, we will submit a representation requesting an ACB enquiry into all irregularities that occurred over the past five years,\" B R Naidu said at a press conference following his visit to the Goshala.\n\nAccording to the chairman, certain individuals are deliberately spreading a \"false campaign\" against the temple administration through mainstream and social media. Refuting these allegations he blamed the previous YSRCP government, stating that it had even failed to provide fodder for the cows during its tenure.\n\n\"They (the YSRCP government) sold donated cows in Ongole and are now engaging in false publicity against the TDP government,\" he alleged, adding that \"God will punish those who commit sins.\" Noting that some individuals are threatening to file Public Interest Litigations regarding the deaths of cows at the Goshala, Naidu said he welcomed such actions, provided the PILs also include complaints about the alleged misuse of TTD funds during the YSRCP's five-year rule. He promised full cooperation with such legal proceedings and maintained that “no irregularities” had taken place at TTD during the past 10 months under the TDP-led NDA government.\n\n\"It is inappropriate to issue petty threats and indulge in cheap, diversionary politics. I strongly condemn this,\" he asserted. Meanwhile, former TTD Chairman and senior YSRCP leader B Karunakara Reddy recently alleged that nearly 100 cows had died at the TTD Goshala in the past three months due to \"negligence\".\n\nDemanding a thorough investigation, Reddy stood by his statement, saying he had done no wrong and did not fear any threats. While TTD Executive Officer (EO) J Shyamala Rao stated that 43 cows had died, BR Naidu claimed the number was 22—both contradicting CM Chandrababu Naidu's claim that there had been no deaths. Accusing the CM, EO, and Chairman of issuing \"conflicting statements\", Reddy said they had failed to handle the issue transparently and questioned their accountability. He urged TTD to stop politicising the matter and to address the alleged mismanagement at the Goshala.",

Previously, during a promotional event for the film, Saif Ali Khan had shared his views about working with Alaya, who had just stepped into the industry. He not only expressed admiration for her ability to stay prepared but also compared her energy to that of the versatile actor Shah Rukh Khan.\n\n“The most special experience that has made it easy for me was working with this brilliant girl (Alaya). I think it’s a new-generation thing. They are so prepared as compared to us when we started. I felt like I was working with the best I have ever worked with. I have worked with Shah Rukh Khan, and it’s been amazing. I felt the same energy with her. It was unbelievable. We’ve done a six-minute scene in one shot, and there was no problem from her side. It’s been incredible,” shared Saif Ali Khan, who is currently gearing up for the release of his upcoming OTT film, 'Jewel Thief: The Heist Begins'.\n\nKnown for praising his co-stars, Saif Ali Khan’s words of praise not only stands unforgettable for Alaya but also solidifies her as a powerhouse Gen-Z female actress who carries the apt energy and dedication as Shah Rukh Khan. Throughout her booming career, Alaya F has chosen to soar past conventionality. She has picked roles ranging from deep intensity and grit, to playing the love interest - all with the sole aim of adding momentum to the story’s plot and leaving behind something impactful. Be it ‘Freddy’, ‘Srikanth’, ‘U-Turn’ or delivering an underrated powerhouse performance in Anurag Kashyap’s 'Almost Pyaar With DJ Mohabbat', Alaya has proven to be the chameleon of Gen-Z actresses who is not shying away from picking genre-defying roles.",

    "content": "Guwahati: In what has been seen as a major setback to the ongoing peace-process in Nagaland, Mr Ikato Chishi Swu, the son of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) or NSCN (I-M)’s late founding leader Isak Chishi Swu, has announced that he is joining dissident NSCN (I-M) leaders Lt Gen (retired) Hs Ramsan and Lt Gen Absalom Raman across the border in Myanmar to continue the struggle.\n\nIn a hard-hitting statement, Mr Swu accused the current leadership of NSCN-IM of straying from the Naga cause and expressed his disappointment at the way the peace talks have been handled since the NSCN-IM and the Government of India signed their first ceasefire agreement in 1997.\n\nMr Swu said that the government started backtracking from the Framework Agreement of 2015 after his father’s death, and did not want to solve the issue but only “manage it and maintain the status quo”. It is significant that the late founder leader of NSCN (I-M) was instrumental in signing the Frame Agreement of 2015.\n\nHe alleged that during the 28 years of ceasefire, the government had succeeded in corrupting NSCN-IM leaders. These trapped leaders, he said, had begun to compromise the Naga “national interest” and many of them were on the payroll of intelligence agencies. Mr Swu also alleged that positions within the NSCN-IM hierarchy could be purchased by paying huge sums of money.\n\nHowever, security sources said that he was not holding significant position in the NSCN (I-M) hierarchy, Mr Ikato Swu joining Mr Ramsan, the vice-chairman and an executive member of the NSCN (I-M)’s steering committee, and Mr Raman, the Deputy Longvibu (Deputy Commander) of the Naga Army could adversely impact the NSCN (I-M)’s credibility among the Nagas from Nagaland as the outfit’s general secretary and Ato Kilonser (Prime Minister) Th Muivah is a Tangkhul Naga from Manipur. Much of the top leadership of the outfit is also dominated by Tangkhuls. The presence of Isak Chisi Swu who was from Nagaland and Ikato, following his death, gave the NSCN (I-M) the image of a united Naga leadership coming from both Manipur and Nagaland.\n\nSources in Nagaland were of view that If Mr Swu, along with Mr Ramsan and Mr Raman, raises a new faction of the NSCN (I-M), it may weaken Mr Muivah’s position and further queer the pitch for an already embattled Naga peace deal.\n\nIndicating that senior NSCN (I-M) leaders were holding consultation within the rank and file to assess the situation, a senior NSCN (I-M) leader however said that the outfit was not going to give any statement against Mr Swu. “However, we are trying to stop the issue from getting blown up,” the leader said.\n\nMr Swu also spoke about a meeting he had with Centre’s pointsman for the Northeast, former Intelligence Bureau additional director A K Mishra, on July 3, 2023.\n\n“I …mentioned that I am a son of the revolution, and my whole life has been affected by it. There are thousands of youths like me whose lives and futures have been shaped by this struggle. Therefore, if you do not solve the issue promptly, I will raise a new force, devise new strategies, and continue the fight until our goal is achieved,” said Mr Swu.",

But I respect the fact and I am very confident of the team that I have around me that is supporting me and Sanju in making these decisions.\"\n\n\"With regards to the specific one on Jofra and Sandeep, Sandeep is someone that we trust. He has been bowling some fantastic overs for us. He has bowled all the difficult overs for us in this tournament. And we completely back him and support him and we felt he was the right bowler for us on that wicket in those conditions with the skills that he has.\"\n\nAfter reports of rift between the captain and head coach emerged, Rahul Dravid addressed the issue.\n\n\"I don't know where these reports are coming from.

Some 22 families at the hilltop village have been evacuated and provided tents and rations. None of the houses have developed any cracks though,\" Nagsini Tehsildar Mohd Rafi Naik told PTI on the phone.\n\nNaik, who is monitoring the situation at the landslide-prone area, said a portion of over 200 metres of the road got damaged due to the sinking, while the continuous shooting stones from the hillock are hampering road clearance operations. He said the district administration is alive to the situation and is keeping a close watch to avoid any untoward incident.\n\nMachail Mata shrine was reopened for the pilgrims only a week ago after winter, marking the commencement of the annual yatra season. However, the closure of the road and the threat of the landslide near Pathernaki hit the yatra. The local residents blamed massive blasting by the executing agency working on the 624 MW Kiru Hydro-Electric project, a run-of-river scheme, as the reason behind the scary situation.\n\nThe district development commissioner, during his visit to the site on Friday, was briefed by officials from the General Reserve Engineer Force (GREF) on the current status of the ongoing restoration and construction works on the damaged route. After a thorough examination of the site, the DDC issued necessary directions to the GREF authorities to expedite the work while ensuring safety and sustainability, an official said.\n\nHe directed the local administration to stay on high alert and conveyed to the GREF authorities the importance of strengthening the affected section to ensure uninterrupted connectivity and to safeguard commuters, especially during the monsoon season. The deputy commissioner advised hydroelectric project authorities to strictly adhere to standard operating procedures (SOPs) to minimise further impact and avoid exacerbating existing cracks.\n\nPathernaki and Kiru segments of the road are highly slide-prone and remain at constant risk of disruptions. Hence, continuous monitoring and prompt responsiveness from all stakeholders remain imperative, the official said.\n\nBJP local MLA Sunil Sharma called for a permanent solution to the issue, saying the area has become prone to frequent landslides over the past one-and-a-half years. \"The concerned agencies have been managing the slide zone temporarily to avoid traffic disruption but the issue needs a permanent solution,\" he said.\n\nSharma, who is also the leader of the opposition in the legislative assembly, said he had already raised the issue with the deputy commissioner and \"we are looking forward to a permanent solution\" to the issue. The closure of the road caused immense hardships to the residents of Paddar and Pangi who are now using an alternate trekking route to move in and out of the region.",

Vasanta Homes Company allegedly manipulated records by designating the land as Survey No. 79/1, misleading authorities to carry out unauthorized constructions. Over 19 acres have been developed with houses sold to buyers, while the remaining 20 acres host an office, sheds, and structures rented to various organizations. These activities continued despite a pending Supreme Court case (C.S.14/58).\n\nHYDRAA demolished structures within the fenced perimeter and installed boards declaring the land as government property.\n\nIn a separate incident in Raidurg, HYDRAA acted on complaints from local youths who reported being barred from playing cricket near Survey No. 5/2 due to encroachments. The agency’s field inspection revealed that Narne Estates was illegally developing up to 39 acres of government land, including a pond, by constructing roads and selling plots in an unauthorized layout. Despite boards indicating a land grabbing case, Narne Estates advertised plots for sale with contact numbers. HYDRAA removed the encroachments, restored the land, and filed a police case against the encroachers, the release said.",

    "content": "With top actress Tamannaah’s maiden female-centric film Odela 2 drawing a lukewarm response in the Telugu states—managing just Rs 1.4 crore in two days—she now joins the list of unlucky actresses like Kajal Aggarwal, Anjali, and Keerthy Suresh, who also failed to pull crowds with solo-led projects.\n\n“Telugu audiences are a bit male chauvinistic and rarely step out to watch women-centric films in theatres. Actresses have often failed to become crowd pullers,” admits producer Lagadapati Sridhar. “While audiences in the region celebrate male heroes in superhero-like roles, they don’t extend the same support to female leads who carry films on their shoulders. It’s unfortunate, yet a sad reality,” he adds.\n\nSridhar points out that the number of successful lady-oriented films in Tollywood has always been few and far between. “Only a handful of actresses have managed to sustain this trend, while most returned to playing romantic interests opposite top heroes. Anushka Shetty and Samantha had a few hits in such roles, but for others, taking on author-backed roles has been a risky proposition,” he explains.\n\nHe further elaborates, “Audiences want glamorous heroines alongside leading male stars. They love seeing them in lover-girl or wife roles, which adds to their fan base. But when these same heroines attempt to ‘turn heroes’ and match their male counterparts in screen dominance, the support often fades. This disparity in audience preferences has hindered many actresses from charting a different path.”\n\nNow, all eyes are on new-age actress Rashmika Mandanna, who is stepping into her first author-backed role with The Girlfriend, after previously romancing big stars like Allu Arjun and Ranbir Kapoor. “I hope young actresses like Rashmika break this jinx and change the game for their peers—much like Shraddha Kapoor did in Bollywood with the blockbuster Stree 2,” Sridhar concludes.",

The scene has been removed from the film with immediate effect. Our intention was not to hurt any religious sentiments. We deeply regret it and have taken quick action to delete the scene from the film. We sincerely apologise to everyone whose beliefs have been hurt.\"\n\nThe response came after a complaint was lodged against actors Sunny Deol, Randeep Hooda, and Vineet Kumar Singh and director Gopichand Malineni, at Jalandhar's Sadar Police Station under Section 299 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita.\n\nVikalp Gold, the complainant from Pholriwal village claimed the movie offended the christian sentiments by depicting the inappropriate crucifixion scene that involved the Christian God, Jesus Christ.\n\nThis controversial scene in Jaat features Randeep Hooda who plays the antagonist in the movie. In the scene his character stands beneath the crucifix, in a church. With his arms stretched out, his pose bears resemblance with the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\n\nIn the scene the frightened worshippers stand in silence as his presence evokes a godly persona.\n\nThe christian community further got offended by the combining religious symbolism with violent scenes. One such controversial scene is during a prayer session where Randeep's character declares that he is sent by Jesus Christ shortly before firing inside the church.\n\nThe sacred objects stained with blood and glasses shattered cause anguish among the viewers as they consider it as sacrilege of their holy place.\n\nAccording to protestors, such scenes and a dialogue in the trailers of the movie can ignite anti-christian sentiments. They have regarded them as extremely offensive.\n\nDays after the movie's release, christian community leaders raised questions over the timing of the film's release date, just after Good Friday.\n\nThe movie Jaat was released on 10th April, starring Sunny Deol and Randeep Hooda in lead roles.",

But it will have to be seen if he carries the momentum into Saturday's match.\n\nSamson is yet to produce a defining knock, with the 66 he made against Sunrisers Hyderabad being his best so far. If Samson is available on Saturday, a lot will depend on his and Jaiswal's form regarding how RR fare against the likes of Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Digvesh Rathi and Ravi Bishnoi.\n\nRiyan Parag and Dhruv Jurel have not made much contribution so far in the batting front and the duo needs to fire if RR have to post or chase down a big total.\n\nNitish Rana came back to form with a 51 against DC after the 81 he made against Chennai Super Kings last month, and he needs to carry on the momentum.\n\nOn the bowling front, Jofra Archer has slowly gotten into his groove.\n\nBut the Royals' attack as a whole has been toothless. Apart from Sandeep Sharma, their other bowlers have struggled to control the scoring rate.\n\nLSG also head into the match after losing to CSK but they are in a much better position currently, with their four wins from seven matches keeping them at fifth spot.\n\nTheir batting form has been impressive overall with Nicholas Pooran (357 runs from seven matches) and Mitchell Marsh (295 from six matches) in top form. Pooran and Marsh are in top and third sports in the batting chart.\n\nSouth African Aiden Markram has also been among runs though compatriot David Miller's form has been a worry with 27 as his highest score in seven matches.\n\nLSG have scored more than 200 runs in three matches and above 160 in all the other games.\n\nFortunately for LSG also, captain Pant has shown some form with 63 off 49 balls against CSK, his first fifty in this IPL from seven matches, though in a losing cause.\n\nLSG's bowling was their weakest link at the start of the competition with injuries to main pacers but made amends later thanks to some on and off performances from Avesh Khan, and Shardul Thakur.\n\nIndia's fastest bowler Mayank Yadav has joined the squad after the last game but the team management is still awaiting his fitness certificate from the Centre of Excellence.\n\nMayank has been recuperating from multiple fitness issues including a lower back stress fracture.\n\nHead-to-head record:\n\nBoth the teams competed against each other on five occasions. Out of which, the Royals have a clear upper hand with a 4-1 record.\n\nEven in their last encounter in 2024, RR registered a 7 wicket win over LSG.\n\nWinning Probability:\n\nThe surface at Sawai Mansingh Stadium would likely favor bowlers, specially spinners. Captain winning the toss might prefer bowling first and look to take advantage of dew as the game progresses.\n\nDespite a dominant show in their past encounters, LSG might have an edge in today's game. With in-form batters and bowlers that are well suited for the conditions, the Pant-led side would be walking into the match as the favorites.\n\nThe Teams (From):\n\nRajasthan Royals: Sanju Samson (c), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Shubham Dubey, Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel (w), Shimron Hetmyer, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Tushar Deshpande, Sandeep Sharma, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kunal Singh Rathore, Akash Madhwal, Kumar Kartikeya, Kwena Maphaka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Ashok Sharma, Vaibhav Suryavanshi.\n\nLucknow Super Giants: Rishabh Pant (c&wk), David Miller, Aiden Markram, Aryan Juyal (wk), Himmat Singh, Matthew Breetzke, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Mitchell Marsh, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Yuvraj Chaudhary, Rajvardhan Hangargekar, Arshin Kulkarni, Ayush Badoni, Shardul Thakur, Avesh Khan, Akash Deep, Manimaran Siddharth, Digvesh Rathi, Akash Singh, Shamar Joseph, Prince Yadav, Mayank Yadav, Ravi Bishnoi.\n\nMatch Starts at 7:30pm.",

    "content": "Anaya Bangar, daughter of India veteran cricketer and commentator Sanjay Bangar, has opened up on her struggles after undergoing a gender change surgery.\n\nIn a recent interview on YouTube channel, 'The Lallantop', she revealed her horrifying experiences.\n\nHaving started her cricket career at the age of 12 as Aryan Bangar, she played alongside some big players including Musheer Khan, Sarfaraz khan, and Yashasvi Jaiswal.\n\nTalking about her cricketing journey she said, \"It was good. I've played for Mumbai Under-16, Pondicherry under-19, and Mumbai under-23 trails as a left hand batter and left arm spinner.\"\n\nSpeaking about nepotism in cricket, she said, \" To some extent it is there, you get the exposure easily but they will also have extra pressure.\"\n\nHowever, she alleged that the cricket world is very toxic, \"I've maintained Secrecy because dad is well known, the cricketing world is filled with insecure and toxic masculinity. The mindset you need to maintain to flourish in Indian cricket is quite a bit narcissistic and toxic.\"\n\n\"It's like in order to excel you need to be a version of yourself, where you need to be dominant but not in a healthy way of competition.\"\n\nAdmitting that she received support from few, Anaya also opened up on some disturbing experiences, \"Yes, I am in touch with some players, there has been some support and there has been some harassment as well. There have been few cricketers, who played at a high level. On a random basis they found out about me and randomly sent me 'nude pictures'.\"\n\n\"While I was in the UK, few were supportive and those who were not supportive, they used to abuse me in front of my teammates and later came and sat with me and asked me to send my pictures.\"\n\nExplaining further, she shared another traumatising experience, \"I told a bade purane (Quite Old) cricketer about my situation and the next thing he said was let's go to your car, I want to sleep with you.\"\n\n\"I just want people to treat us with respect and treat us as equal human beings,\" she lamented.\n\nLast year, Anaya came out publicly about her gender-identity with a painful Instagram post, where she expressed grief over losing her athletic abilities due to hormone replacement therapy.",

Shine, along with his lawyers, arrived at the Ernakulam North Police Station by around 10 am, according to police sources.\n\nThe purpose of the questioning is to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the actor's alleged escape from the hotel during the search operation. On Friday, the police served a notice to the actor, directing him to appear for questioning at Ernakulam North Police Station at 10 am on Saturday.\n\nThe questioning is being conducted by a team led by the Ernakulam Central Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP). It was on Wednesday night, upon realising that the police team had arrived, Shine escaped from his third-floor room jumping out of the window onto the second floor of the hotel that comes under the Ernakulam North Police limits. Then he leapt into the swimming pool on the same floor and escaped through the staircase, police sources added.\n\nAs no drugs were recovered from the hotel, no case has been registered in connection with the incident. Though his family informed the police he would appear by 3 pm Chacko arrived by 10 am. Earlier, film actor Vincy Aloshious in a complaint lodged before the Film Chamber accused Chacko of \"inappropriate behaviour\" towards her under the influence of drugs.\n\nThough the actress also complained to the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) about the alleged misconduct of Chacko on the sets of the yet-to-be-released movie, 'Soothravakyam', she has not lodged a police complaint.",

    "content": "Washington: A class action lawsuit filed Friday asks a federal court to reinstate the legal status of international students caught up in a Trump administration crackdown that has left more than a thousand fearful of deportation.\n\nThe suit filed by several American Civil Liberties Union affiliates seeks to represent more than 100 students in New England and Puerto Rico.\n\n\"International students are a vital community in our state’s universities, and no administration should be allowed to circumvent the law to unilaterally strip students of status, disrupt their studies, and put them at risk of deportation,” said Gilles Bissonnette, legal director of the ACLU of New Hampshire.\n\nAt schools around the country, students have seen their visas revoked or their legal status terminated , typically with little notice.\n\nAbout 1,100 students at more than 170 colleges, universities and university systems have been affected since late March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements, correspondence with school officials and court records. The AP is working to confirm reports of hundreds more students affected.\n\nStudents have filed other lawsuits arguing they were denied due process. Federal judges have granted temporary restraining orders in New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Montana, shielding students from efforts to remove them from the U.S.\n\nPlaintiffs in the new lawsuit, filed in federal court in New Hampshire, learned without warning their F-1 student statuses had been terminated, leaving in doubt their ability to stay in the country and finish their studies, according to the complaint.\n\nOne of them, Manikanta Pasula of India, was on the brink of getting his master’s in computer science at Rivier University in New Hampshire and applying to remain in the country through a work program for international students. Hangrui Zhang of China had come to the U.S. for a Ph.D. program in electronic and computer science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts. Now, he cannot work as a research assistant, which was his only source of income, the complaint said.\n\nThe government did not give notice it is required to provide before terminating a foreign student’s legal status, the lawyers said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nLast month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the State Department was revoking visas held by visitors who were acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel’s war in Gaza and those who face criminal charges.\n\nIn some high-profile cases, such as that involving Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil , the Trump administration has cited involvement in pro-Palestinian activism as a rationale for deportation.\n\nBut colleges say most students affected by visa revocations played no role in those protests. Many are being singled out over minor infractions such as traffic violations that occurred long ago, and in some cases the reason is unclear, colleges say.",

    "content": "Ahmedabad: Mitchell Starc's mastery of death overs will be up against Mohammed Siraj's artistry when the high-flying Delhi Capitals take on an equally well-placed Gujarat Titans in a high-voltage top-of-the-table IPL clash here on Saturday.\n\nThe Capitals sit pretty at the top with 10 points from six games, while the Titans trail close behind with eight from as many outings.\n\nConfidence in the Delhi camp would be soaring after their dramatic Super Over win over Rajasthan Royals, another heist scripted under pressure with Starc at the heart of it.\n\nThe Australian left-arm quick bowled three overs of pinpoint yorkers, including a nerve wracking Super Over, to turn the game on its head.\n\nHaving skipped the Champions Trophy to freshen up after the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Starc has returned to the IPL recharged and razor sharp.\n\nWith 10 wickets at an economy just over 10, he's led the DC pace unit featuring Mukesh Kumar and Mohit Sharma. If Starc can conjure another match-defining spell, it could be the edge that Delhi needs.\n\nHis battle with Gujarat Titans' top order, led by skipper Shubman Gill, the consistent Sai Sudharsan, and Ashes rival Jos Buttler, could prove pivotal.\n\nSo far, the trio has carried the bulk of the batting load, with at least one of them notching a half-century in every match.\n\nThe GT middle order, largely untested, faltered when finally called upon against Lucknow Super Giants, resulting in a defeat. If Delhi can crack that top-order code early, the ripple effect could tilt the contest in their favour.\n\nOn the other hand, after an underwhelming Border-Gavaskar Trophy and missing India's Champions Trophy-winning campaign, Siraj used his time away from the game to iron out flaws and the results are showing.\n\nRefreshed and raring, Siraj has emerged as the cornerstone of Gujarat Titans' bowling attack this season.\n\nWith his Test-match lengths and ability to generate movement off the deck, he has picked up 10 wickets at an economy of 8.50, particularly excelling in the Powerplay.\n\nUp against him will be Delhi's relatively inexperienced opening duo of Jake Fraser-McGurk, who has struggled for rhythm, and the promising Abishek Porel.\n\nThe pair will have their work cut out not just against Siraj but also Prasidh Krishna, who is enjoying a standout season.\n\nShould Delhi's top order crumble early, the Capitals will look towards the experience of KL Rahul and Karun Nair to steady the ship.\n\nAxar Patel, who plays for Gujarat in the domestic circuit, too will be eager to make an impact at his home-ground, having rediscovered his rhythm with both bat and ball.\n\nBoth teams also boast of high-quality spin arsenals.\n\nWhile Gujarat have banked on the reliable duo of Sai Kishore and Rashid Khan, Delhi's standout performer has been Kuldeep Yadav, ably supported by the impressive Vipraj Nigam.\n\nHowever, Kuldeep's availability is uncertain after he walked off the field with a shoulder injury in the last match, and the Capitals are yet to provide a fitness update.\n\nHead-to-head record\n\nOut of the five encounters between GT and DC, Capitals has a slight edge winning three, while the Titans won two games.\n\nIn their last encounter in 2024, Delhi Capitals registered a win by 4 runs.\n\nWinning Probability:\n\nBoth the teams have a balanced and in-form side. With top order batting units from both sides looking in good touch, the performance of bowlers becomes key.\n\nStarc and Kuldeep for DC, Siraj and Rashid for GT would be crucial.\n\nThe Narendra Modi Stadium generally has a batting friendly surface. The last three matches played at this venue witnessed big totals. The average first innings score at the ground is 219.\n\nInterestingly, all the three matches were won by the team batting first. Captain's winning the toss would prefer batting first.\n\nIn their respective last matches, Delhi successfully managed to win a low-scoring game against LSG in a thrilling super over. While GT handed over a comfortable win to Lucknow after failing to defend a 180-run total.\n\nDelhi might have a slight edge in today's game as well given their deep batting strength and composure under pressure situations.\n\nSquads:\n\nDelhi Capitals: Axar Patel (C), Faf du Plessis, Karun Nair, Sameer Rizvi, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Ashutosh Sharma, KL Rahul, Abishek Porel, Donovan Ferreira, Tristan Stubbs, Madhav Tiwari, Tripurana Vijay, Manvanth Kumar, Vipraj Nigam, Ajay Mandal, Darshan Nalkande, Mukesh Kumar, Mohit Sharma, T Natarajan, Mitchell Starc, Dushmantha Chameera, Kuldeep Yadav.\n\nGujarat Titans: B Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (Captain), Jos Buttler (wk), Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar, Karim Janat.\n\nMatch starts 3:30pm.",

    "content": "Mumbai: Former South Africa wicketkeeper-batter Mark Boucher believes out-of-form Mumbai Indians veteran batter Rohit Sharma is showing signs of returning to rhythm in the IPL and a big knock is just around the corner.\n\nRohit has failed to reach the 50-run mark in six matches this season with the 26 he scored against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Thursday being his highest score.\n\n\"Rohit Sharma took it upon himself to go after the bowlers. We saw some good old-fashioned Rohit Sharma sixes - big ones too. I liked his attitude,\" Boucher, a former Mumbai Indians head coach, said.\n\n\"He put the bowlers under pressure, created scoring opportunities. He was just past the 30-mark -- a big score is coming very soon. He's looking in that zone again,\" he told 'Jiostar'.\n\nBoucher also reflected on the performance of MI skipper Hardik Pandya, whose 21 off just nine balls with three fours and a six took Mumbai to the threshold of victory.\n\n\"Hardik Pandya is one of the best all-rounders in the world. When he's firing, the team usually wins. I love his new role with the ball - he's not just bowling in the power play, but in the tough middle overs, the 'ugly overs'.\n\n\"And he's picking up wickets there too. That's giving him confidence, and it's translating into his batting, where he's going in and finishing games.\"\n\nOn the all-round performance of Will Jacks, he said, \"Will Jacks has been under pressure and hasn't performed like he'd have wanted at the start of the competition. But he is amazing - he's a genuine all-rounder and more than just a part-time spinner.\"\n\n\"He bowled really well and picked up some crucial wickets. That would've fed into his batting confidence too - finally feeling like he's contributed. There's no reason he can't carry this momentum and do some fantastic things like he has for other franchises and for England.\"\n\nFormer India batter Ajay Jadeja also shared his perspective on Pandya.\n\n\"Hardik Pandya is a character, and he is leading from the front -- whether it's batting, bowling, fielding, or even off the field. He's always smiling. The one thing about him\" he never gives up.\n\n\"Last year wasn't the best for him, but this year, even without great results early on, he's stayed true to his style.\"\n\nJadeja feels MI's turnaround came in the Super Over win against Delhi Capitals on April 16.\n\n\"The turnaround, in my opinion, came in the last game against Delhi Capitals. Most teams would've given up. But Mumbai Indians clawed back and that's Hardik Pandya for you. That was the game that may well have turned their season around.\n\n\"Tonight was a bonus. It was a comfortable win, but the Delhi game showed what MI and Hardik are made of. When Hardik Pandya walks in, even when the team needs 10, 12, 15 runs an over, you still feel they've got a better chance with him at the crease.\"",

    "content": "New Delhi: India's first prototype fast-breeder reactor in Tamil Nadu's Kalpakkam is expected to be commissioned next year, nearly two years after it got the go-ahead from the nuclear regulator, officials have said.\n\nThe commissioning of the Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) will mark the second stage of India's three-stage nuclear programme that aims to recycle spent fuel to reduce the inventory of radioactive waste.\n\nThe PFBR being developed in Kalpakkam is the first-of-its-kind nuclear reactor to use plutonium-based mixed oxide as fuel and liquid sodium as coolant. It will also utilise the spent fuel of Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors, which form the mainstay of nuclear power in India at present.\n\nWhile the state-run Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) operates nuclear power plants in the country, the PFBR in Kalpakkam is being developed by the Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam (BHAVINI).\n\n\"BHAVINI's 500 MW PFBR is in the advanced stage of integrated commissioning, with expected first criticality by 2025-26,\" Department of Atomic Energy officials recently told the parliamentary standing committee on science and technology.\n\nThey had told the committee that the first criticality of the PFBR was expected to be achieved in March and the plant would be completed by September 2026.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi witnessed the commencement of core loading in the nuclear reactor in March last year.\n\nLast July, the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) granted permission for loading of fuel, first approach to criticality and conducting low-power physics experiments for the PFBR.\n\nPFBRs are critical for India's nuclear programme as the spent fuel from these reactors will be used to power the thorium-based reactors that form the third stage of the closed fuel cycle.\n\nThe government has announced a nuclear energy mission that aims to produce 100 GW electricity through nuclear power.\n\nAt present, India's installed nuclear power capacity stands at 8.18 GW. An additional 7.30 GW nuclear energy projects are under construction or commissioning and 7.00 GW have been sanctioned and are currently undergoing pre-project activities.\n\nUpon completion of these projects, India's nuclear power capacity is expected to reach 22.48 GW by 2031-32.\n\nBeyond this, NPCIL plans to add another 15.40 GW through indigenous Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors and 17.60 GW through Light Water Reactors with foreign cooperation, bringing the total installed capacity to 55 GW.\n\nAdditionally, BHAVINI is expected to contribute 3.80 GW through Fast Breeder Reactors while the remainder of the capacity will come from Small Modular Reactors, Bharat Small Reactors, and other advanced nuclear technologies developed with private sector collaboration.",

    "content": "Beijing: Twenty-one humanoid robots joined thousands of runners at the Yizhuang half-marathon in Beijing on Saturday, the first time these machines have raced alongside humans over a 21-km (13-mile) course.\n\nThe robots from Chinese manufacturers such as DroidVP and Noetix Robotics came in all shapes and sizes, some shorter than 120 cm (3.9 ft), others as tall as 1.8 m (5.9 ft). One company boasted that its robot looked almost human, with feminine features and the ability to wink and smile.\n\nSome firms tested their robots for weeks before the race. Beijing officials have described the event as more akin to a race car competition, given the need for engineering and navigation teams.\n\n\"The robots are running very well, very stable ... I feel I'm witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,” said spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence.\n\nThe robots were accompanied by human trainers, some of whom had to physically support the machines during the race.\n\nA few of the robots wore running shoes, with one donning boxing gloves and another wearing a red headband with the words \"Bound to Win\" in Chinese.\n\nThe winning robot was Tiangong Ultra, from the Beijing Innovation Center of Human Robotics, with a time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. The men's winner of the race had a time of 1 hour and 2 minutes.\n\nThe centre is 43% owned by two state-owned enterprises, while tech giant Xiaomi’s (1810.HK) robotics arm and leading Chinese humanoid robot firm UBTech have equal share in the rest.\n\nTang Jian, chief technology officer for the robotics centre, said Tiangong Ultra’s performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon.\n\n\"I don't want to boast but I think no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangong's sporting achievements,\" Tang said, adding that the robot switched batteries just three times during the race.\n\nSome robots struggle\n\nSome robots, like Tiangong Ultra, completed the race, while others struggled from the beginning.

One crashed into a railing after running a few metres, causing its human operator to fall over.\n\nAlthough humanoid robots have made appearances at marathons in China over the past year, this is the first time they have raced alongside humans.\n\nChina is hoping that investment in frontier industries like robotics can help create new engines of economic growth. Some analysts, though, question whether having robots enter marathons is a reliable indicator of their industrial potential.\n\nAlan Fern, professor of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics at Oregon State University, said contrary to claims from Beijing officials that such a race requires \"AI breakthroughs\", the software enabling humanoid robots to run was developed and demonstrated more than five years ago.\n\n\"Chinese companies have really focused on showing off walking, running, dancing, and other feats of agility.\n\n\"Generally, these are interesting demonstrations, but they don't demonstrate much regarding the utility of useful work or any type of basic intelligence,\" Fern said.\n\nTang, the robotic centre's CTO, said: \"A focus going forward for us will be industrial applications for humanoid robots so they can truly enter factories, business scenarios, and finally households.\"",

    "content": "Bengaluru: Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer has called Yuzvendra Chahal \"one of the best bowlers\" in the Indian Premier League and said he has asked the seasoned leg-spinner to always look for wickets instead of worrying over leaking runs during a \"personal chat.\" After a subdued start to the this edition of the T20 tournament, the Punjab Kings spinner has found his rhythm and took the wickets of Rajat Patidar and Jitesh Sharma in PKBS' five-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bengaluru here on Friday.\n\n\"Personally I had a chat with Chahal. I told him you are a match winner and you need to get us wickets as much as possible. You don't need to be safe in your approach and he has got the capability of bouncing back. That's what we appreciate of him as a leggie,\" Iyer said.\n\n\"He is one of the best bowlers in the IPL, probably the best bowler in the IPL so far. You to back that all the time,\" he said after the win over RCB.\n\nPunjab Kings produced an inch-perfect bowling effort to restrict RCB to 95 for nine in a rain-curtailed 14 overs-a-side match at the Chinnaswami Stadium.\n\nIn reply, PBKS competed the chase in 12.1 overs with Nehal Wadhera making a match-winning 19-ball 33.\n\nThe Player of the Match award, however, went to RCB's Tim David who proved to be their lone-ranger in an otherwise forgettable batting display, with a blazing 50 off 26 balls.\n\n\"As they say variety is the spice of life. We are able to experience all kinds of games over here. It is a great challenge,\" Iyer said.\n\n\"There was no thinking to be honest. I was making instinctive moves and obviously we were getting wickets. I didn't want the new batsman to come in and settle straightaway,\" the skipper said of his decisions on the field.\n\nAsked to bat first, RCB lost wickets at regular intervals with the likes of Arshdeep Singh, Chahal, Marco Jansen and Harpreet Brar doing the bulk of the damage for the visiting team.\n\n\"Marco was able to extract little bit of bounce on this wicket. He was bowling lethal. He basically steadied the ship. And the rest of the bowlers they helped him.\n\n\"To be honest, we didn't know how the wicket was going to play and I personally feel the bowlers they adapted according to it,\" Iyer said.\n\n\"When I had a chat with Arshdeep, he said, the hard length balls were very difficult to hit on this wicket because I didn't see a single six off a fast bowler hit down the ground. That was the chatter going around and they were fantastic in executing it.\"\n\nOn expected lines, Iyer lavished praise on Wadhera for his attacking knock.\n\n\"Yes absolutely, you need one batsman to take the charge. Nehal was brilliant in his approach today. The attitude was top notch. I hope he continues the same form.\"\n\nCould have done better as batting unit: Patidar\n\nRCB skipper Rajat Patidar acknowledged that his batters left a lot to be desired, especially those slotted in the middle-order as the pitch eased up a bit in the second half of their innings.\n\n\"Initially it was sticking and two paced, but we could have done far better as a batting unit. Partnerships are important, we have lost wickets in quick intervals and that's a big lesson for us,\" Patidar said.\n\nAsked about leaving out Devdutt Paddikal from the playing XI, he said the decision was made taking into account the conditions.\n\n\"We've had to make that change due to conditions. The wicket wasn't that bad, it was under covers for a long time, it helped their bowlers, credit goes to them. No matter how the wicket plays, we need to bat well and get a winning total.\n\n\"The bowling unit is doing pretty well, that's a big positive. The batters have played with intent, that's something pleasing. We can correct some of our mistakes in the batting unit,\" Patidar said.",

    "content": "Speaking exclusively on Kuhl Fans Match Centre Live on JioHotstar, JioStar expert Mark Boucher commented on Punjab Kings’ performance: \"They’ll be very happy with that win, especially after the tight finish in the last game. I think for Ricky, there was a moment where he thought it might go down to the wire again. But Nehal Wadhera came in, and as we've seen so often, when he plays, he plays with freedom. He’s striking the ball very sweetly at the moment and finished off what could’ve been another close one.”\n\nJioStar expert Sanjay Bangar on Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s innings:\n\n\"A couple of early dismissals were understandable — they were trying to set a good score, and in a rain-curtailed game, you don’t really have a clear idea of what’s enough. But the way Livingstone and Jitesh got out, and you'd expect a little more from Krunal Pandya as well — those three were disappointing. At one point, they were in danger of being bowled out for under 50. Credit to Tim David though — he held on and made a bit of a match out of it with a well-composed drift.”\n\nMark Boucher on Arshdeep Singh’s bowling and match-ups:\n\n\"We spoke about him being a match-up to Phil Salt, and that’s exactly what he was tonight. What I really enjoyed was how he changed his length — when they saw that a full length wasn’t working, he pulled back to a hard length, and it worked. He led the bowling unit well, picked up wickets, and the whole attack bowled aggressively. Some great captaincy from Shreyas Iyer too.”\n\nSanjay Bangar on RCB’s struggles at their home ground:\n\n\"They’d be worried, to be honest, with the kind of surfaces they’re getting. Who would’ve expected the amount of bounce that was on offer on this pitch? Nobody expected that. If that continues, this is no longer a batting-friendly surface or venue. RCB may need to recalibrate their batting approach to get things back on track in home games.”",

    "content": "Washington: The United States will roughly halve the number of troops it has deployed in Syria to less than 1,000 in the coming months, the Pentagon said Friday.\n\nWashington has had troops in Syria for years as part of international efforts against the Islamic State (IS) group, which rose out of the chaos of the country's civil war to seize swaths of territory there and in neighboring Iraq over a decade ago.\n\nThe brutal jihadists have since suffered major defeats in both countries, but still remain a threat.\n\n\"Today the secretary of defense directed the consolidation of US forces in Syria... to select locations,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement, without specifying the sites where this would take place.\n\n\"This deliberate and conditions-based process will bring the US footprint in Syria down to less than 1,000 US forces in the coming months,\" he said.\n\n\"As this consolidation takes place... US Central Command will remain poised to continue strikes against the remnants of (IS) in Syria,\" Parnell added, referring to the military command responsible for the region.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has long been skeptical of Washington's presence in Syria, ordering the withdrawal of troops during his first term but ultimately leaving American forces in the country.\n\nAs Islamist-led rebels pressed forward with a lightning offensive last December that ultimately overthrew Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Trump said Washington should \"NOT GET INVOLVED!\"\n\n\"Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT,\" Trump, then the president-elect, wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nYears of war against IS\n\nThe 2014 onslaught by IS prompted a US-led air campaign in support of local ground forces -- the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Iraqi government units.\n\nWashington also deployed thousands of American personnel to advise and assist local forces, with US troops in some cases directly fighting the jihadists.\n\nAfter years of bloody warfare, Iraq's prime minister announced a final victory over IS in December 2017, while the SDF proclaimed the defeat of the group's \"caliphate\" in March 2019 after seizing its final bastion in Syria.\n\nBut the jihadists still have some fighters in the countryside of both countries, and US forces have long carried out periodic strikes and raids to help prevent the group's resurgence.\n\nWashington stepped up military action against IS in Syria in the wake of Assad's overthrow, though it has more recently shifted its focus to strikes targeting Yemen's Huthi rebels, who have been attacking international shipping since late 2023.\n\nUS forces in Iraq and Syria were repeatedly targeted by pro-Iran militants following the outbreak of the Gaza war in October 2023, but responded with heavy strikes on Tehran-linked targets, and the attacks largely subsided.\n\nWashington for years said it had some 900 military personnel in Syria as part of international efforts against IS, but the Pentagon announced in December 2024 that the number of US troops in the country had doubled to around 2,000 earlier in the year.\n\nWhile the United States is reducing its forces in Syria, Iraq has also sought an end to the US-led coalition's presence there, where Washington has said it has some 2,500 troops.\n\nThe United States and Iraq have announced that the coalition would end its decade-long military mission in federal Iraq by the end of 2025, and by September 2026 in the autonomous Kurdistan region.",

    "content": "Washington: US President Donald Trump warned Thursday that Washington would \"take a pass\" on talks to end the Ukraine war within days unless there is rapid progress from Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nHis comments came just hours after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio set the clock ticking, saying in Paris that the United States could \"move on\" from its role brokering the negotiations.\n\nTrump has been pressing both sides for a truce, but has failed to extract any major concessions from the Kremlin despite an ice-breaking call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and repeated negotiations with Moscow.\n\n\"If for some reason one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say: 'You're foolish. You're fools. You're horrible people' -- and we're going to just take a pass,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\n\"But hopefully we won't have to do that.\"\n\nRepublican Trump refused to cast blame on either Putin, who ordered the February 2022 full-scale invasion of pro-Western Ukraine, or Kyiv's President Volodymyr Zelensky, insisting both sides had to make progress.\n\nBut Trump warned that a decision on whether to abandon the talks could come \"very shortly\". \"No specific number of days, but quickly. We want to get it done,\" he added.\n\n'Move on'\n\nMoscow has kept up strikes on Ukraine, killing at least two people and wounding dozens more in attacks on the northeastern regions of Kharkiv and Sumy, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nOne of the few commitments Trump had wrangled from Russia -- a temporary moratorium on striking Ukrainian energy infrastructure -- \"expired\" on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in response to an AFP question.\n\nAfter meeting European officials in Paris to discuss a ceasefire, Rubio said Washington needed to figure out soon whether a ceasefire was \"doable in the short term.\"\n\n\"Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on,\" he told reporters.\n\nBut speaking on a trip to Italy, US Vice President JD Vance still insisted he was \"optimistic\" about ending the three-year war.\n\nTrump promised to end the war within 24 hours of taking office but has little to show for his efforts so far.\n\nHe has embarked on a rapprochement quest with the Kremlin that has alarmed Kyiv and driven a wedge between the United States and its European allies.\n\nHe and Vance also had a blazing Oval Office row in February with Zelensky, whom he still accuses of bearing responsibility for Moscow's invasion.\n\nTrump insisted that he was not being \"played\" by Moscow, which is accused by Ukraine of dragging its feet.\n\n\"My whole life has been one big negotiation and I know when people are playing us and I know when they're not,\" the billionaire property tycoon added.\n\nAsked if Putin was stretching out the process, Trump added: \"I hope not. I'm going to let you know about that soon if he is... he's got a big force out there.\"\n\n'Mockery'\n\nZelensky meanwhile slammed the latest attacks on his country, which came just days before Easter.\n\nKyiv earlier announced it had received the bodies of 909 soldiers from Russia.\n\n\"This is how Russia started Good Friday -- with ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, Shahed drones. A mockery of our people and cities,\" Zelensky said on Telegram.\n\nRussia said it had hit \"key drone production sites\" and Ukrainian military airfields.\n\nPutin last month rejected a joint US-Ukrainian proposal for a full and unconditional pause in the conflict, while the Kremlin has made a truce in the Black Sea conditional on the West lifting certain sanctions.\n\nTrump has also repeatedly expressed anger and frustration at Zelensky in a marked break from his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nUkraine is set to sign a deal next week in Washington that would give the United States sweeping access to its mineral resources.\n\nEuropean powers have meanwhile been seeking a seat at the table in the negotiations, particularly as Trump's administration insists the continent should share the burden for Ukraine's security.\n\nFrance hosted meetings between US and European officials in Paris on Thursday, saying the talks had launched a \"positive process.\"\n\nThe meetings included French President Emmanuel Macron, Rubio and US envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nMany allies have however been alarmed by Witkoff -- who recently met Putin in Russia -- repeating Moscow's talking points about the war.",

    "content": "Hodeida: US strikes on a Yemeni fuel port killed at least 80 people, Huthi rebels said Friday, in the deadliest attack of Washington's 15-month campaign against the Iran-backed group.\n\nThursday's strikes on Ras Issa aimed to cut off supplies and funds for the rebels that control large swathes of the Arabian Peninsula's poorest country, the US military said.\n\nImages broadcast by a Huthi-run television channel showed large blazes lighting up the night sky following the latest in an intensified barrage of attacks under US President Donald Trump.\n\nHuthi media later reported fresh strikes in and around the capital Sanaa on Friday night.\n\nHuthi health ministry spokesman Anees Alasbahi said rescuers were still searching for bodies at the fuel terminal on the Red Sea, suggesting the number of dead could rise.\n\nThe rebels' Al-Masirah TV, citing local officials, said the toll from the strike had \"risen to 80 dead and 150 wounded\".\n\nThe Huthis later announced missile attacks targeting Israel and two US aircraft carriers. Israel's military said on Friday it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen.\n\nProtesters chanting \"Death to America! Death to Israel!\" gathered in rebel-held cities around the country, including at a major demonstration in the capital Sanaa.\n\n\"The American military buildup and continued aggression against our country will only lead to more counterattack and attack operations, clashes and confrontations,\" Huthi military spokesman Yahya Saree told the crowd in Sanaa.\n\n'Signal to Tehran'\n\nThe strikes on Thursday came as the United States prepares to resume negotiations with Iran over its nuclear programme in Rome on Saturday, following warnings that Tehran is getting closer to building an atomic weapon.\n\n\"The military actions in Yemen are clearly sending a signal to Tehran,\" Mohammed Albasha, a US-based consultant, told AFP.\n\nThe US military has hammered the Huthis with near-daily air strikes for the past month in a bid to stamp out their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nEarlier on Friday, when the Ras Issa toll stood at 74, Alabashi said the overall number of deaths from renewed US strikes since March was 198.\n\nClaiming solidarity with Palestinians, the rebels began attacking the key maritime route and Israeli territory after the Gaza war began in October 2023.\n\nThey paused their attacks during a recent two-month ceasefire.\n\nIn a statement, US Central Command (CENTCOM) said: \"US forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Huthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Huthi efforts to terrorise the entire region for over 10 years.\"\n\nAl-Masirah TV, citing authorities at the port, said the attack had caused \"significant damage\" that \"will affect navigation and the supply of oil\".\n\nThe US strikes began in January 2024 but have multiplied under Trump, starting with an offensive that killed 53 people on March 15.\n\nFootage broadcast early Friday by Al-Masirah showed a fireball igniting off the coast as thick columns of smoke rose above what appeared to be an ongoing blaze.\n\nThe Huthi TV station later screened interviews with survivors lying on stretchers, including one man with burns on his arms.\n\n\"We ran away. The strikes came one after the other, then everything was on fire,\" one man who said he worked at the port told Al-Masirah.\n\nShipping attacks\n\nIsrael carried out air strikes on Ras Issa and elsewhere in Yemen in January, describing the targets as military infrastructure. Similar Israeli strikes that also included Ras Issa took place in September.\n\nIran called the latest US strikes \"barbaric\", while Hamas Palestinian militants denounced them as \"blatant aggression\".\n\nThe US bombing campaign intensified last month following Huthi threats to resume attacks on international shipping in protest at Israel's blockade of aid to Gaza.\n\n\"The message today is unmistakable: the US is targeting not only Huthi military assets and personnel, but also their economic infrastructure,\" Albasha said.\n\nHuthi attacks on the Red Sea shipping route, which normally carries about 12 percent of global trade, have forced many companies into costly detours around the tip of southern Africa.\n\nSeparately, US State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce accused the Chinese satellite firm Chang Guang Satellite Technology Company of \"directly supporting\" Huthi attacks on \"US interests\".\n\nBruce did not initially provide details, but later referred to \"a Chinese company providing satellite imagery to the Huthis\".",

    "title": "White House Site Blames China For Covid-19 'Lab Leak'",
    "link": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/white-house-site-blames-china-for-covid-19-lab-leak-1873771",
    "content": "Washington: The White House on Friday unveiled a revamped Covid-19 website that promoted the contentious theory that the virus leaked from a Chinese laboratory, framing it as the pandemic's \"true origins.\"\n\nThe Covid.gov website, previously focused on promoting vaccine and testing information, now includes a full-length image of President Donald Trump and criticizes the pandemic policies implemented under former president Joe Biden.\n\nThe site also targets Anthony Fauci, Biden's former chief medical advisor, for advancing what it calls the \"preferred narrative that Covid-19 originated naturally.\"\n\nIt presents five bullet points aimed at bolstering the lab leak theory, noting that Wuhan, the site of the first known coronavirus case, is also home to China's \"foremost SARS research lab\" and has a history of conducting research at \"inadequate biosafety levels.\"\n\n\"By nearly all measures of science, if there was evidence of a natural origin it would have already surfaced. But it hasn't,\" the website said.\n\nThe lab-leak theory, once dismissed as a conspiracy theory, has recently gained mainstream traction in the United States.\n\nEven as the debate remains unresolved -- scientifically and politically -- US agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Energy have come out in support of the theory, albeit with varying levels of confidence.\n\nEarlier this year, the Central Intelligence Agency shifted its official stance on the virus's origin, saying that it was \"more likely\" leaked from a Chinese lab than transmission from animals.\n\nThe assessment drew criticism from China, which said it was \"extremely unlikely\" Covid-19 came from a laboratory.\n\nBeijing also urged the United States to \"stop politicizing and instrumentalizing the issue of origin-tracing.\"\n\nThe United States and China are currently locked in a major trade war, with Washington announcing Thursday new port fees for Chinese-linked ships and increased tariffs for Chinese goods.\n\nThe revamped White House site, which apparently seeks to redefine the political narrative about Covid-19, also criticized the mask and social distancing mandates introduced at the start of the pandemic in 2020. There is also a map of Wuhan that is animated to throb.\n\nUnder a section titled \"Covid-19 misinformation,\" it also accused public health officials under the previous administration of demonizing \"alternative treatments\" and colluding with social media companies to censor dissenting views about the pandemic -- a charge frequently echoed by US conservatives.\n\nThe Biden administration has previously rejected the charge that it was suppressing or censoring conservative perspectives.\n\nThe website revamp comes after layoffs began earlier this month at major US health agencies, as the Trump administration embarks on a sweeping and scientifically contested restructuring that will cut 10,000 jobs.\n\nHealth secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr -- who has alarmed health experts with his rhetoric downplaying the importance of vaccines -- said the layoffs were part of a major reform of his department, aiming to refocus efforts on chronic disease prevention.\n\nMore than one million people died of Covid-19 and related illnesses in the United States, and millions more were lost around the world.",

    "content": "Deir Al-Balah: Israeli airstrikes across Gaza killed at least 25 people on Friday including children, hospital workers said, as the new U.S. ambassador to Israel made his first public appearance in Jerusalem.\n\nThe dead included 15 people killed in three strikes on the southern city of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. Ten people were killed in Jabaliya, including eight from the same home, according to the Indonesian Hospital, where the bodies were brought.\n\nThe strikes came a day after more than two dozen people died in Gaza as Israel continued attacks, pressuring Hamas to disarm and return hostages it took in October 2023.\n\nAmbassador arrives in Jerusalem U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee visited the Western Wall on Friday, the holiest Jewish prayer site in Jerusalem’s Old City. He inserted a prayer into the wall, which he said was handwritten by U.S. President Donald Trump. \"Those are his initials, D.T.,“ said Huckabee while showing the note to the media.\n\nIn his first act as ambassador, Huckabee said Trump told him to pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Huckabee also said every effort was being made to bring home the remaining hostages held by Hamas. A one-time presidential hopeful, Huckabee has acknowledged his past support for Israel’s right to annex the West Bank and incorporate its Palestinian population into Israel but said it would not be his “prerogative” to carry out that policy.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital over Palestinian objections and moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv. Palestinians seek the eastern part of the city, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as their future capital.\n\nHuckabee's arrival comes at a pivotal time in the 18-month war, as international mediators including the U.S. are trying to get a broken ceasefire back on track.\n\nIsrael is demanding that Hamas release more hostages at the start of any new ceasefire and ultimately agree to disarm and leave the territory. Israel has said it plans to occupy large “security zones” inside Gaza.\n\nKhalil al-Hayya, head of Hamas’ negotiating delegation, said Thursday the group had rejected Israel’s latest proposal along those lines. He reiterated Hamas’ stance that it will return hostages only in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a full Israeli withdrawal and a lasting truce, as called for in the now-defunct ceasefire agreement reached in January.\n\nHamas currently holds 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.\n\nFriday’s airstrikes came a day after aid groups raised alarm over Israel’s blockade of of Gaza, where it has barred entry of all food and other goods for more than six weeks. Thousands of children have become malnourished, and most people are barely eating one meal a day as stocks dwindle, the United Nations said.\n\nIsrael’s Defense Minister says the blockade is one of the “central pressure tactics” against Hamas, which Israel accuses of siphoning off aid to maintain its rule. Aid workers deny there is significant diversion of aid, saying the U.N. closely monitors distribution. Rights groups have called it a “starvation tactic.”\n\nGaza’s Christians mark Good Friday As Israel continued its offensive, Palestinian Christians gathered inside Gaza’s Greek Orthodox Church of St. Porphyrios to mark the Good Friday holiday. Worshippers clad in black bowed their heads in prayer and lit votive candles to commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus.\n\nA building in the St. Porphyrios compound was hit soon after the war began in October 2023, killing more than a dozen people taking refuge there. Friday’s holiday was the second Good Friday celebrated in Gaza since then. St. Porphyrios is believed to be the third oldest church in the world, according to the World Council of Churches.\n\nGaza was home to about 1,300 Christians before the start of the war, according to the U.S. State Department.\n\nThe war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Most of the hostages have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.\n\nIsrael’s offensive has since killed over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants . The war has destroyed vast parts of Gaza and most of its food production capabilities. The war has displaced around 90% of the population, with hundreds of thousands of people living in tent camps and bombed-out buildings.",
