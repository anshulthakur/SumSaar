- [*] Create a `steps.md` file to track progress.
- [*] **Frontend (Django Template):**
    - [*] Locate the main page navbar in the Django templates.
    - [*] Add a "Fetch" button to the navbar.
    - [*] The button will trigger a POST request to a new URL endpoint (e.g., `/fetch-articles`).
- [*] **Backend (Django Views & URLs):**
    - [*] Create a new URL pattern in `sumsaar/webserver/chitrapat/urls.py` that maps `/fetch-articles` to a new view function.
    - [*] Create a new view function in `sumsaar/webserver/chitrapat/views.py` that will:
        - [*] Receive the POST request.
        - [*] Trigger a Celery task to fetch the articles.
        - [*] Return a JSON response to the frontend indicating that the fetch process has started.
- [*] **Celery Task:**
    - [*] Find where the celery tasks are defined.
    - [*] Create a new celery task to fetch the articles.
    - [*] Make sure the celery task is registered with the celery app.
- [*] **Verification:**
    - [*] Check the frontend to make sure the button is present and that it sends the POST request.
    - [*] Check the backend to make sure the view receives the POST request and triggers the celery task.
    - [*] Check the celery worker to make sure the task is executed.
